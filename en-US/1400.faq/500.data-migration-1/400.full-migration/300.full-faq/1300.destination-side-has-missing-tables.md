# What do I do if the destination table does not exist?

## Exception information

```shell
destination side has missing tables
```

## Troubleshooting procedure

1. Connect to the destination database and check whether the destination table exists. Make sure that you use the migration account to connect to the destination database.

2. If the destination database or table does not exist, connect to the database as a database administrator (DBA) and check whether the destination table exists.

   * If the table exists, it indicates that the migration user does not have privileges on the data dictionary and therefore cannot find the table information.

   * If the table does not exist, check whether the table schema migration is faulty.
