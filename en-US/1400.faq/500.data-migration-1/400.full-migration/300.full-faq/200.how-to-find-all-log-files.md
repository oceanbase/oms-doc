# How do I query log files of the Checker component of OMS?

1. Identify the server where the OMS Docker container resides based on the IP address in the component ID.

   Generally, the ID of a component is in the format of IP-PORT:INNER ID:SEQ, for example, xxx.xxx.xxx.1-9000:90322:0000000111. For more information about how to query component IDs, see [How do I query the ID of a checker](../3.full-faq/1.how-to-find-full-task-id.md).

2. Run the following command to log on to the Docker container of OMS:

   ```bash
   # Obtain the name of the OMS Docker container.
   sudo docker ps
   # Assume that the name of the OMS Docker container is oms. Enter the Docker container.
   sudo docker exec -it oms bash
   ```

3. The log files of the Checker component of OMS are located in the `/home/ds/run/{component ID}/logs` directory, which contains the `task.log` and `error.log` log files.

   * `task.log`: contains general logs.

   * `error.log`: contains error logs.
