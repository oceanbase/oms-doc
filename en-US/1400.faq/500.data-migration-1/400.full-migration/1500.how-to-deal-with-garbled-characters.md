# What do I do if garbled characters cannot be written into OceanBase Database V3.1.2?

## Symptom

During data migration, garbled characters cannot be written into OceanBase Database V3.1.2.

1. Log on to the sys tenant from OceanBase Client (OBClient).

   ```sql
   obclient -h host IP address -P port number -u username -p 'password' -D default database -Ac --prompt "OceanBase(\u@\d)> "
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to set the value of `_enable_static_typing_engine` to `false`:
