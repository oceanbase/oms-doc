# How do I start or stop a JDBCWriter?

This topic describes how to start and stop a JDBCWriter in the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) console.

## Applicable versions

OMS V3.2.2 and later

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

3. On the **Data Migration** page, click the name of the target project to go to its details page.

4. Click **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner.

5. Click **Pause** in the **Actions** column of the JDBCWriter component. Wait for a while and refresh the page. The state of the JDBCWriter changes to **Stopped**.

6. Click **Start** in the **Actions** column of the JDBCWriter component. Select whether to perform pullback and click **Start**.

   * If you do not need a data pullback, click **Start** directly. The JDBCWriter pulls back data based on the stop timestamp.

   * If you need a data pullback, select **Yes** and set the timestamp for pullback. The timestamp is between the earliest and latest pullback timestamps of the store component. Click **Start**. The JDBCWriter pulls back data based on the specified timestamp.
