# What do I do when the "Failed to fetch" error is reported?

This topic describes what to do when the "Failed to fetch" error is reported.

## Symptom

When you log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition, a `Failed to fetch` error is reported.

## Possible causes

If the fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets is enabled, the network may be disconnected when you access OMS Community Edition. As a result, a `Failed to fetch` error is reported.

## Troubleshooting procedure

1. Log on as the root user to the host where OMS Community Edition is deployed.

2. Run the following command to check whether the fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets is enabled.

   If the returned value is `1`, the fast recycling is enabled. If the returned value is `0`, the fast recycling is disabled.

   ```shell
   sudo sysctl -a |grep tcp_tw_recycle
   ```

3. If returned value is `1`, run the following command to change the parameter value to `0` to disable the fast recycling of TIME_WAIT sockets:

   ```shell
   sudo sysctl -w  net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle=0
   ```
