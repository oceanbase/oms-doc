# Increase the disk space of the OMS host

This topic describes how to increase the disk space of the server that hosts OceanBase Migration Service (OMS).
Assume that the path of the original disk is `/data/1` and that of the new disk is `/exta`. On the OMS host, run the `ln -s  /exta  /data/1` command. This command sets the actual path `/exta` to the symbolic link `/data/1`, which ensures that you can go to the `/exta` directory when you access the `/data/1` directory.
