# Delete a connector 

To reduce redundant connectors and save resources, you can delete stopped connectors. 

## Limits 

* You can delete only connectors corresponding to projects in the Stopped state.

  

* You cannot delete connectors corresponding to projects in the Running state.

  

* If an error is reported when a data synchronization project is running, the project and corresponding connectors need to be deleted before a new synchronization project is created.


## Prerequisites 

You have stopped the connector.

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console.


2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

   

3. On the **Components** page, click the **Connector** tab.

   

4. On the **Connector** page, you can search for the target connector by connector name, IP address, or data synchronization project. 

5. Click **Delete** in the Actions column of the target connector.

   

6. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and then click **Delete**.
