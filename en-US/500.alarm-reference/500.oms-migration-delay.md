# oms_migration_delay

## Impact on the system

This alert affects the real-time performance in incremental data migration and reverse data migration. If this alert is left unhandled for a long time, the migration project cannot be recovered.

## Possible causes

* The source or destination database is not properly configured.

* Privileges are not properly assigned.

* The network is disconnected.

* Other special circumstances have occurred.

## Solution

Access the details page of the migration project, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner, and then choose **View Component Monitoring** to view the timestamp information about the store used for pulling logs and the JDBCWriter used for real-time synchronization.

* If the store has a high latency, check for information about errors or exceptions in its logs.

* If the timestamp information of the store is basically in real time but the JDBCWriter has a high latency, check the logs of the JDBCWriter for error or exception information.

* If no specific error message is found, provide the symptoms and component logs to Technical Support of OMS Community Edition.
