# oms_sync_delay 



## Impact on the system 

This alert affects the real-time performance of data synchronization. If this alert is left unhandled for a long time, the data synchronization task cannot be recovered.

## Possible causes 

* The source and destination databases are not properly configured.

  

* Privileges are not properly assigned.

  

* The network is disconnected.

  

* Other special circumstances have occurred.

  




## Solution 

Go to the details page of the data synchronization project, and click **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner to view the timestamp information of the Store and Connector components. 

* If the Store component has a large delay, check its logs to check whether an error or exception has occurred.

  

* If the checkpoint of the Store component is basically in real time but the Connector component has a large delay, check the logs of the Connector component to check whether an error or exception has occurred.

  

* If no specific error message is found, feed back the phenomenon and component logs to technical support engineers of OMS Community Edition.
