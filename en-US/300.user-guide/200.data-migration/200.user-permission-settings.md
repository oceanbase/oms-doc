# User privileges

Before you migrate data between databases by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition, ensure that you have created a database user for each data source as the migration or synchronization user. The user must have the required privileges on the source and destination data sources.

## Create a database user

Before using the data migration or synchronization feature of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition, you must create dedicated database users in the source and destination databases for the data migration or synchronization task, and grant corresponding permissions to these users.

### Create a MySQL database user

1. Log on to a self-managed MySQL database.

2. Create a user in the self-managed MySQL database for data migration or synchronization.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER '<user_name>'@'<host_name>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
   ```

   | Parameter |             Description            |
   |-----------|------------------------------|
   | username  | The account to be created.        |
   | host_name | The host from which the account is allowed to log on to the database. To allow the account to log on to the database from any host, set this parameter to a percent sign (%). |
   | password  | The password of the account.         |

### Create a OceanBase database Community Edition user

1. Log on to OceanBase database Community Edition as the system administrator.

2. Create a user in OceanBase database Community Edition for data migration or synchronization.

   ```shell
   CREATE USER '<oms01>' IDENTIFIED BY '<123456>';
   ```

## User privileges required when a MySQL database serves as the source

* The database user must have the read privilege on the database from which data is migrated.
  
  ```shell
  GRANT SELECT ON <database_name>.* TO '<user_name>';
  ```

* The privilege required by the database user to perform incremental synchronization of a MySQL database.
  
   ```shell
   GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO <user_name> WITH GRANT OPTION;
   ```

* The database user must have the `SELECT *.*` privilege to synchronously pull incremental logs.
  
  ```shell
  GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO '<user_name>';
  ```

* Enable binlogs for the MySQL database.
  
  When OMS Community Edition is performing full data migration tasks, it reads the binlogs of the source MySQL database to synchronize incremental data to the destination database in real time. Before migrating incremental data from a MySQL database by using OMS Community Edition, you must enable binlogs for the MySQL database.

  The binlog configuration of the MySQL database is checked in the precheck step of a data migration task. If an error occurs during the precheck, enable binlogs for the MySQL database by performing the following operations.

   1. Log on to the host where the self-managed MySQL database resides.

   2. Run the following command to modify the `my.cnf` file of the MySQL database.

      The `my.cnf` file is stored at `/etc/my.cnf` by default.

      ```shell
      log_bin=mysql_bin
      binlog_format=row
      binlog_row_image=full // This setting is required if the source database version is MySQL 5.6 or later.
      ```

   3. Run the following command to restart the MySQL database.

      [$Mysql_Dir] must be replaced with the installation path of the MySQL database.

      ```javascript
      [$Mysql_Dir]/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p ******
      [$Mysql_Dir]/bin/safe_mysqld &
      ```

   4. Log on to the self-managed MySQL database and execute the following SQL statement to confirm that the binlog feature is enabled.

      ```javascript
      show variables like '%log_bin%';
      ```

      In the returned information, both `log bin` and `sql log bin` must be ON to indicate that the binlog feature is enabled.

## User privileges required when a MySQL database serves as the destination

Run the following command to authorize the user in the MySQL database.

```shell
GRANT <privilege_type> ON <database_name>.<table_name> TO '<user_name>'@'<host_name>' [WITH GRANT OPTION];
```

|     Parameter     |     Description         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| privilege_type        | Grant `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and other operation permissions to the account. To grant all permissions to the account, set this parameter to ALL.                       |
| database_name  | The name of the database. To grant operation permissions on all databases to the account, set this parameter to an asterisk (\*).                                             |
| table_name       | The name of the table. To grant operation permissions on all tables to the account, set this parameter to an asterisk (\*).                                                   |
| user_name     | The account to be authorized.                                        |
| host_name             | The host from which the account is allowed to log on to the database. To allow the account to log on to the database from any host, set this parameter to a percent sign (%). |
| WITH GRANT OPTION | Grant the account the permission to use the `GRANT` command. This parameter is optional.                                                                                      |

## User privileges required when an OceanBase database Community Edition serves as the source

Run the following command to authorize the user in the OceanBase database Community Edition.

```shell
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO <oms_user> WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON *.* TO <oms_user>;

CREATE USER '<__oceanbase_inner_drc_user>' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO '<__oceanbase_inner_drc_user>';
```

## User privileges required when an OceanBase database Community Edition serves as the destination

The migration user in a MySQL tenant of OceanBase database Community Edition must have the following privileges when migrating data from a MySQL database to the MySQL tenant of OceanBase database Community Edition:

* The `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges on the business database.

* The `SELECT` privilege on the OceanBase databases, information_schema, and MySQL databases.
