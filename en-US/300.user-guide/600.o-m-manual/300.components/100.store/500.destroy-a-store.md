# Destroy a store

To reduce redundant stores and save resources, you can destroy abnormal or stopped stores.

## Limits

After a store is destroyed, it will be permanently deleted from the server and cannot be recovered. Proceed with caution.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**. The **Store** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** tab, click **Destroy** in the **Actions** column of the target store. The target store must be in the **Abnormal** or **Stopped** state.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Store**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter stores by region and destroy the abnormal or stopped stores in the target region.

4. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and then click **Delete**.
