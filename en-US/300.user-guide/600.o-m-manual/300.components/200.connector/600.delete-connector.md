# Delete a connector

To reduce redundant connectors and save resources, you can delete stopped connectors. 

## Limits

* You can delete only connectors corresponding to projects in the Stopped state. 

* You cannot delete connectors corresponding to projects in the Running state. 

* If an error is reported when a data synchronization project is running, the project and corresponding connectors need to be deleted before a new synchronization project is created. 

## Prerequisites

You have stopped the connector. For more information, see [Start and pause a connector](../2.connector/2.stop-or-start-the-connector.md). 

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition. 

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**. 

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Connector** tab. 

4. On the **Connector** tab, you can search for the target connector by connector name, IP address, or data synchronization project.  

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Connector**. 

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter connectors by region and delete connectors in the target region. 

5. Click **Delete** in the **Actions** column of the target connector. 

6. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and then click **Delete**.
