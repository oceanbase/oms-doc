# View server logs

If you encounter a fault or a high latency during a data migration or synchronization project, you can view the logs of the specific server components for troubleshooting.

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to view server logs in a secure and convenient manner without the need to log on to the specific server.

## Prerequisites

You have identified the components that are in error and obtained the IP address of the corresponding server. The underlying component name of the task resource contains the IP address of the server to which it belongs.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Server**.

3. Click **View Logs** in the **Actions** column of the target server.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Server**, and the region column is not displayed.

   * For multi-region deployment, you filter servers by region and view the logs of servers in the target region.

4. Specify **Log Position**.
