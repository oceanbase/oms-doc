# Create a project to synchronize data from an OceanBase database Community Edition to a RocketMQ instance

Message Queue for Apache RocketMQ is a distributed message-oriented middleware built by Alibaba Cloud based on Apache RocketMQ. It features a low latency, high concurrency, and high reliability. The data synchronization feature of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition enables you to synchronize data between an OceanBase physical table and a RocketMQ data source in real time, extending the message processing capability. 

## Prerequisites

A topic with the partition ordered messages property is created in your RocketMQ instance.

## Limits 

* Only physical tables can be synchronized.

* When data transfer is resumed on a link, some data (within the last minute) may be duplicated in the DataHub instance, and deduplication is required in downstream applications.

* The names of the destination table and its columns cannot contain Chinese characters.

## Procedure

1. Create a data synchronization project. 

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.
   
   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.
   
   3. On the **Data Synchronization** page, click **Create Synchronization Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select the Source and the Destination** page, specify the following parameters. 

   |          Parameter           |                                     Description                     |
   |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Synchronization Project Name | The name must not exceed 64 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and letters.                                                                                                      |
   | Tag                          | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags.                                             |
   | Source Node                  | If you have created a physical data source of OceanBase Database, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list to add one in the dialog box on the right side.|
   | Destination Node             | If you have created a RocketMQ data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list to add one in the dialog box on the right side.                            |

3. Click **Next**.

4. On the **Select Synchronization Types and Objects** page, select **Synchronization Type and Configuration** of the current data synchronization project. 

   **Synchronization Type and Configuration** supports only **DML for Data Change** in **Incremental Synchronization** , including `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`.
   

5. On the **Select Synchronization Types and Objects** page, select the synchronization range. 

   When you synchronize data from an OceanBase database to a RocketMQ instance, you can select multiple tables to map to multiple topics. 

   1. Select target objects on the left side of the selection section.
   
   2. Click **\>**.
   
   3. Click the **Existing Topics** drop-down list in the **Map the Object to the Topic** dialog box and select the target topic.

   4. Click **OK**. 

      After you select the target object, you can modify the topics and remove the single object or all objects. The structure of the target object is Topic \> DataBase \> Table. 

      |            Operation            |           Procedure     |
      |---------------------------------|-------------------------|
      | Change Topic                    | <ol><li>Move the pointer over the target object in the right list of the selection section.<li>Click **Change Topic**.<li>Click **OK**. <br> **Notice:**  The selected topics and table are merged to the selected topics. <li>Modify topics in the **Map the Object to the Topic** dialog box.</ol>                   |
      | Set the parameters              | You can select sharding columns and columns to synchronize.<ol><li>Move the pointer over the target object in the right list of the selection section. <li>Click **Settings**. <li>In the **Settings** dialog box, you can click the **Shard Columns** drop-down list and select the target sharding columns. You can select multiple fields as sharding columns. This parameter is optional. <br> When you select sharding columns, the primary key is selected by default. If the primary key does not implement load balancing, select a unique field with balanced load as a sharding column. <br> Ensure that the selected sharding columns are correct. An incorrect sharding column will cause data synchronization to fail. Sharding columns can be used for the following purposes: <ul><li>Load balancing: Threads used for sending messages can be recognized based on the sharding columns if the target table supports concurrent writes.<li>Orderliness: OMS Community Edition ensures that messages are received in order if the values of the sharding columns are the same. The orderliness specifies the sequence of executing DML statements for a column. </ul><li>Click **OK**.</ol>       |
      | Remove an object or all objects | You can remove an object or all objects.  <ul><li>Remove an object. Move the pointer over the target object in the right list of the selection section and click **Remove** to remove the object.<li>Remove all objects. Click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner of the right list in the selection section. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all the objects.</ul>                     |

6. Click **Next**.

7. On the **Synchronization Option** page, specify the following parameters. 
   
   <table>
        <tr>
        <td><b>Category  </td>
        <td><b> Parameter</td>
        <td><b>Description </td>

        <td> Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp</td>
        <td><ul><li>If you selected <b>Full Synchronization</b> when you set Synchronization Type and Configuration, the synchronization start time is the project start time by default and this time cannot be modified.<li>If you do not select <b>Full Synchronization</b> when you set Synchronization Type and Configuration, specify a point in time to start data synchronization. The synchronization start time is the current system time by default. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp. <br><b>Notice:</b>  Only the current time or an earlier point in time can be selected as the synchronization start time. This timestamp is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp. </ul>  </td>
        <tr>
        <td rowspan="4">Advanced Options  </td>
        <td>Serialization Method  </td>

        </tr>
        <td>Enable Intra-transaction Sequence </td>
        <td>You can enable transaction sorting as needed. If you enable this feature, OMS marks each transaction sent to downstream devices. </td>

        <tr>
        <td>Partitioning Rules </td>
        <td>This parameter specifies the rule of synchronizing data from an OceanBase database to a RocketMQ topic. OMS supports only <b>Hash</b>.

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Business System Identification (Optional) </td>
        <td>This parameter specifies the business system ID of the data source. It can be customized. The ID must be 1 to 20 characters in length. </td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Whether to Allow Message Tracing</td>
        <td>This parameter specifies whether to allow message tracing. If message tracing is enabled, you can trace the entire link information of a message in the procedure from sending the message to the RocketMQ server to message consumption, including node time and status. The message tracing feature provides data support for troubleshooting in the production environment. </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

8. Click **Precheck**. 

   During **Precheck**, OMS Community Edition detects the connection with the destination data source. If the precheck fails, identify the cause, fix the problem, and run the precheck again until it succeeds.
   

9.  Click **Start Task** to start different incremental synchronization tasks of the project. 

   If you do not want to immediately start any task, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data synchronization project. You can manually start the project.
