## View synchronization details

In the **Synchronization Details** section, you can view information about **Schema Synchronization**, **Incremental Synchronization Log Pull**, **Full Synchronization**, and **Incremental Synchronization**. Schema synchronization creates a topic. After the schema synchronization is completed, you can query the new topic.

The **Incremental Synchronization** section displays the latency and the current timestamp of the data synchronization project. Based on this information, you can learn the running status and performance of the data synchronization project.

The **Incremental Synchronization Performance** section displays the latency and traffic of incremental data synchronization in real time. You can view changes in synchronization performance by period or in real time.

**Synchronization Latency** displays the status and latency of the Store, Writer, and Connector components. **Synchronization Traffic** displays the TPS and IOPS of the JDBCWriter component. In the upper-right corner of the **Incremental Synchronization Performance** section, you can filter synchronized incremental data by **Last 1 Hour**, **Last 24 Hours**, **Last 7 Days**, or a custom period of time.

## View and modify synchronization objects

On the details page of the data synchronization project, click **View Synchronization Objects** in the upper-right corner to view synchronization objects of the project.

When you synchronize data from OceanBase Database to a RocketMQ or Kafka instance, you can modify the synchronization objects of a paused data synchronization project.

1. Pause the data synchronization project.

   If the project has been paused, skip this step.
   1. On the details page of the project whose objects you want to modify, click **Pause** in the upper-right corner.

   2. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

2. On the details page of the project, click **View Synchronization Objects** in the upper-right corner.

3. In the **View Synchronization Objects** dialog box, click **Modify Synchronization Objects** in the lower-right corner.

4. In the **Modify Synchronization Objects** dialog box, add or remove the objects as needed.

   You can also move the pointer over the object that you want to modify in the **Destination Objects** list, and change the topic or set ETL options.

5. Click **OK**.
