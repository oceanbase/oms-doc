# Create a project to synchronize data from an OceanBase database Community Edition to a Kafka instance

Kafka is a widely used high-performance distributed stream computing platform. OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition supports real-time data synchronization between a self-managed Kafka instance and MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database, extending the message processing capability. Therefore, OMS Community Edition is widely applied to business scenarios such as real-time data warehouse building, data query, and report distribution.

OMS Community Edition enables you to synchronize data to message queue products, extending all-round application of your business in big data fields, such as monitoring data aggregation, streaming data processing, and online/offline analysis.

## Limits

* Only physical tables can be synchronized.

* The Kafka version must be 0.9, 1.0, or 2.x.

* During data synchronization, if you rename a source table to be synchronized and the new name is beyond the synchronization range, the data of the source table will not be synchronized to the destination Kafka instance.

* When data transfer is resumed on a link, some data within the last minute may be duplicate in the Kafka instance, so deduplication is required in downstream systems.

* The name of a table to be synchronized, as well as the names of columns in the table, must not contain Chinese characters.

## Procedure

1. Create a data synchronization project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.

   3. On the **Data Synchronization** page, click **Create Synchronization Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, specify related parameters.

   |    Parameter     |                                                                                                                                                                                   Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   |------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Project Name     | It must not exceed 64 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and letters.       |
   | Tag              | Click the field and select a tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, or delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data synchronization projects](../4.manage-data-synchronization-projects/4.use-tags-to-manage-data-synchronization-projects.md).md).                                                                                                                      |
   | Source   | If you have created an OceanBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Add an OceanBase Community Edition data source](../../3.manage-data-sources/1.add-a-data-source/1.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md). |
   | Destination  | If you have created a Kafka data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Add a Kafka data source](../../3.manage-data-sources/1.add-a-data-source/4.add-a-Kafka-data-source.md).                                      |

3. Click **Next**. On the **Select Synchronization Type** page, specify **Synchronization Type and Configuration** for the current data synchronization project.

   Options available for **Synchronization Type and Configuration** include **Schema Synchronization**, **Full Synchronization**, and **Incremental Synchronization**. **Full Synchronization** supports tables without primary keys. **Incremental Synchronization** supports only **DML for Data Change**, which includes `Insert`, `Delete`, and `Update`.

4. (Optional) Click **Next**.

   If the source database is an OceanBase database, you must configure the obconfig_url parameter, username, and password for incremental synchronization.

   If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** without configuring the required parameters for the source database, the **More About Data Sources** dialog box appears to prompt you to configure the parameters.

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity** . After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

5. Click **Next**. On the **Select Synchronization Objects** page, select a synchronization scope.

   When you synchronize data from an OceanBase database to a Kafka instance, you can synchronize data from multiple tables to multiple topics.

   1. In the left-side pane, select the objects to be synchronized.

   2. Click **\>**.

   3. In the **Map Object to Topic** dialog box, select a mapping method.

      If you did not select **Schema Synchronization** when you set the synchronization type and configuration, you can select only **Existing Topics** here. If you have selected **Schema Synchronization** when you set the synchronization type and configuration, you can select only one mapping method to create or select a topic.

      For example, if you have selected Schema Synchronization, when you use both the Create Topic and Select Topic mapping methods or rename the topic, a precheck error will be reported due to option conflicts.

      |       Parameter       |                                                                                                                                 Description                                                                                                                                  |
      |-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Create Topic          | Enter the name of the new topic in the text box. The topic name contains 3 to 64 characters, and can contain only letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).                                                                                            |
      | Select Topic          | OMS Community Edition allows you to query Kafka topics. You can click **Select Topic**, and then find and select the topics to be synchronized from the **Existing Topics** drop-down list.  You can also enter the name of an existing topic and select it after it appears. |
      | Batch Generate Topics | The format for generating topics in batches is: `Topic_${Database Name}_${Table Name}`.                                              |

      If you select **Create Topic** or **Batch Generate Topics**, you can query the newly created topics in the Kafka instance after schema synchronization is completed. By default, each Kafka topic has three partitions and each partition has one replica, which cannot be modified.

   4. Click **OK**.

   When you synchronize data from an OceanBase database to a Kafka instance, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects from text and perform the following operations on the objects in the destination database: change topics, set row filtering conditions, and remove a single object or all objects. Objects in the destination database are listed in the structure of Topic \> Database \> Table.

   |     Operation     |         Steps          |
   |-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | Import Objects    | <ol><li>In the list on the right, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.   <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.  **Notice**  This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li> In the **Import Synchronization Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be synchronized.  <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of synchronization objects](../4.manage-data-synchronization-projects/5.download-and-import-the-settings-of-synchronization-objects.md).   <li> Click **Validate**.   <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**.    </ol>                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | Change Topic      | <ol><li> In the list on the right, hover the pointer over the target object.   <li> Click **Change Topic** .   <li> In the **Map Object to Topic** dialog box, change the topics to be synchronized.  <li> Click **OK** .  **Notice**  The selected topics and tables will be merged to the selected topic. Proceed with caution.   </ol>                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | Settings          | You can use the `WHERE` clause to filter data by row, select sharding columns, and select columns to be synchronized. <ol><li>In the list on the right, hover the pointer over the target object.   <li> Click **Settings**.   <li>In the **Settings** dialog box, you can perform the following operations:  <ul><li> In the **Row Filters** section, specify a standard SQL `WHERE` clause to filter data by row.  Only the data meeting the `WHERE` condition is synchronized to the destination data source, thereby filtering data by row. If the statement contains a reserved SQL keyword, add an escape character (\`).   <li> Select the target sharding columns from the **Sharding Columns** drop-down list. You can select multiple fields as sharding columns. This parameter is optional.  Unless otherwise specified, select the primary keys as sharding columns. If the primary keys are not load-balanced, select fields with unique identifiers and whose load is balanced as sharding columns.  Ensure that the selected sharding columns are correct. An incorrect sharding column will cause data synchronization to fail. Sharding columns can be used for the following purposes: <ul><li> Load balancing: Threads used for sending messages can be recognized based on the sharding columns if the target table supports concurrent writes.   <li> Orderliness: OMS Community Edition ensures that messages are received in order if the values of the sharding columns are the same. The orderliness specifies the sequence of executing DML statements for a column.  </ul> <li>In the **Select Columns** section, select the columns to be synchronized. If you select all or no columns, OMS Community Edition will synchronize all columns. </ul>    <li> Click **OK**.</ol>    |
   | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single synchronization object or all synchronization objects. <ul><li>  Remove a single synchronization object In the list on the right, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove** to remove the synchronization object.   <li> Remove all synchronization objects In the list on the right, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all synchronization objects.</ol>                                                            |

6. Click **Next**. On the **Synchronization Options** page, specify the following parameters.

   |         Category         |                  Parameter                  |                                                                                                      Description                                                           |
   |--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Synchronization Settings | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have selected **Full Synchronization** when you set the synchronization type and configuration, the value here is the project start time by default and cannot be modified.  <li>If you did not select **Full Synchronization** when you set the synchronization type and configuration, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp.  <br>**Notice:**<br>  You can select the current time or a point in time earlier than the current time. This parameter is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp.  </ul>  |
   | Advanced Options         | Serialization Method                        | The message format for synchronizing data to a Kafka instance. Valid values: **Default**, **Canal**, **Dataworks** (version 2.0 supported), **SharePlex**, and **DefaultExtendColumnType**. For more information, see [Data formats](../2.data-formats.md).                                                                               |
   | Advanced Options         | Enable Intra-Transaction Sequence           | Specifies whether to maintain ordering within a transaction. If this feature is enabled, OMS Community Edition marks the sequence number for a transaction to be sent to a downstream node.  <br>**Notice:** <br> This parameter is valid only for the **SharePlex** format and is intended for you to obtain the sequence numbers of the DML statements that form a transaction.  <br>For example, if a transaction contains 10 DML statements numbered from 1 to 10, OMS Community Edition will deliver these statements to the destination database in the same order.  If this option is enabled, the system performance may be affected. Choose whether to enable it based on the business characteristics.                                                                                                                    |
   | Advanced Options         | Partitioning Rules                          | The rule for synchronizing data from an OceanBase database to a Kafka topic. Valid values: **Hash** and **One**.  <ul><li> **Hash** indicates that OMS Community Edition uses a hash algorithm to select the partition of a Kafka topic based on the value of the primary key or sharding column.   <li> **One** indicates that JSON messages are delivered to a partition under a topic to ensure ordering.  If this option is enabled, the system performance may be affected. Choose whether to enable it based on the business characteristics.   </ul>                         |
   | Advanced Options         | Business System Identification (Optional)   | Identifies the source business system of data. The business system identifier consists of 1 to 20 characters.                         |

7. Click **Precheck**.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition detects the connection with the destination Kafka instance. If the project fails the precheck, identify the cause, fix the problem, and run the precheck again until the project passes the precheck.

8. Click **Start Project**.

   If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data synchronization project. You can start the project later as needed. For more information, see [View details of a data synchronization project](../4.manage-data-synchronization-projects/1.view-details-of-a-data-synchronization-project.md).
