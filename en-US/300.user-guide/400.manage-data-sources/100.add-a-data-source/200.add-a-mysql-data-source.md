# Add a MySQL data source 

You must configure data sources before creating a data migration project. Before you start a data migration task, you must add a MySQL database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to add a MySQL database as a data source by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition. 

## Prerequisites 

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.


* You have created a database user for data migration. 

  We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for data migration and grant the required data operation privileges to the user.
  
## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

   

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

   

4. In the **Add Data Source** panel, select **MySQL** for **Endpoint Type**.

   

5. Specify the fields. 

   

   |        **Field**        |                                                        **Description**                                            |

   | Data Source ID          | The name of the data source.  The name must be 1 to 32 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and case-sensitive English letters.    |
   | Database Attributes     | Database attributes include **Primary Database**, **Primary Database + Standby Database**, and **Standby Database**. <br> When you configure the primary database, you can choose whether to select the following option: **Allow OMS to automatically write incremental heartbeat data to the instance during incremental synchronization**. <ul><li>If you select the option, OMS creates the `drc.heartbeat` table in the MySQL database and updates the table to monitor the operating of the Store. <li>If you do not select the option, OMS does not create the `drc.heartbeat` table. </ul>    |
   | Host IP                 | The IP address of the host where the database is located.                                                               |
   | Port                    | The port number of the IP address of the host where the database is located.     |
   | Username                | The name of the MySQL database user for data migration or synchronization.        |
   | Password                | The password of the database user.      |
   | Optional. Database Name | The name of the MySQL database.                                                 |
   | Optional. Remarks       | Additional information about the data source.          |

   

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the network connection between OMS and the data source, as well as the validity of the username and password. You can specify a database as the source or destination.

   

7. After the connection test succeeds, click **Add**.
