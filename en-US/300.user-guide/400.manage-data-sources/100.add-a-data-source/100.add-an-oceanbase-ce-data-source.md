# Add an OceanBase-CE data source 

You must configure data sources before creating a data migration project. In OceanBase Database, you must add an OceanBase database Community Edition as the source or destination data source before you start a data migration task. This topic describes how to add an OceanBase-CE data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition. 

## Prerequisites 

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.


* You have created a database user for data migration.

We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for data migration and grant the required data operation privileges to the user. 

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Add Data Source** panel, select **OceanBase-CE** for **Endpoint Type**.

   

   |        **Field**        |        **Description**        |
   |-------------------------|-------------------------------|
   | Data Source ID          | The name of the data source.  The name must be 1 to 32 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and case-sensitive English letters.               |
   | Connection Method       | Valid values: **Manual Input** and **Command-line Connection String** . * **Manual Input** : Enter the public IP address and port number of the OceanBase database.   * Optional. **Command-line Connection String** : Enter a command-line connection string.         |
   | Host IP                 | The IP address of the host where the database is located.                        |
   | Port                    | The port number of the IP address of the host where the database is located.  | 
   | Tenant Name             | The name of the OceanBase database tenant.   |
   | Cluster Name            | The name of the cluster to which the OceanBase database tenant belongs.  |
   | Tenant Type             | The type of the OceanBase database tenant Community Edition.  |
   | Optional. OCP           | The OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster associated with the data source. Select an OCP cluster from the drop-down list.  <br>**Note**  <ul><li>Check whether the data source is managed in the selected OCP cluster.<li>This parameter ensures that OMS obtains the incremental data of the OceanBase database. If you do not specify this parameter, you cannot select Incremental Migration, Incremental Synchronization, or Reverse Incremental Migration. </ul>   If the OCP cluster is not available in the list, click **Add OCP Cluster**, and configure the parameters on the **Add Associated OCP Cluster** page. |
   | Username                | The name of the OceanBase database user for data migration or synchronization. We recommend that you create a separate database user for data migration or synchronization.                           |
   | Password                | The password of the database user.     |
   | Optional. Database Name | The name of the database.     |
   | Optional. Remarks       | Additional information about the data source.     |

   

5. Click **Test Connection** to test the network connection between OMS and the data source, as well as the validity of the username and password.


6. After the connection test succeeds, click **Add**.
