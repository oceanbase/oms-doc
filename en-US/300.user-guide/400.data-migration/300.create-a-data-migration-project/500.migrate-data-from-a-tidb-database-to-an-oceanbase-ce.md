# Create a project to migrate data from a TiDB database to OceanBase database Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from a TiDB database to OceanBase database Community Edition.

## Limits

* Only TiDB 4.x and 5.4 are supported.

* You can migrate only tables with primary keys from a TiDB database to OceanBase database Community Edition.

* You cannot migrate space-containing data from a TiDB database to OceanBase database Community Edition.

* During reverse incremental migration from a TiDB database to OceanBase database Community Edition that is contains a multi-partition table with a globally unique index, data may be lost if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

## Create a data migration project

1. Create a migration project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, set the required parameters.

   |       Parameter        |                Description                                               |
   |------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | It must not exceed 64 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and letters.                                                                                               |
   | Tag                    | Click the field and select a tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, or delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](../400.manage-data-migration-projects/500.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).                                                                                                                                      |
   | Source            | If you have created a TiDB data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Add a TiDB data source](../../300.manage-data-sources/100.add-a-data-source/300.add-a-tidb-data-source.md).  **Notice**  If the TiDB data source is not bound to a valid Kafka data source or a topic, incremental synchronization is not supported. |
   | Destination       | If you have created a data source of an OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Add an OceanBase Community Edition data source](../../300.manage-data-sources/100.add-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).             |

3. Click **Next**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   Note that this project supports only tables with a primary key or a non-NULL unique index. Other tables are automatically filtered out.

5. On the **Select Migration Type** page, set the required parameters.

   The following options are available for **Migration Type** : **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification** , and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   |        Migration type         |                                             Limits                           |
   |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Full Migration                | If you select **Full Migration** , we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics of the TiDB database before data migration.                                                   |
   | Incremental Synchronization   | **Incremental Synchronization** supports the following DML statements for data changes: `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`. You can select statements based on your business needs.  If you create a TiDB data source without binding it to a Kafka data source, you cannot select **Incremental Synchronization**.                        |
   | Full Verification             | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification** , we recommend that you collect the statistics of the TiDB database and the OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode before full verification.    <li> If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but do not select all DML statements in the DML for Data Change section, you cannot select **Full Verification** .  </ul>  |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li> Multiple tables are aggregated.   <li> Multiple schemas in the source match one schema in the destination.                                                |

6. Optional. Click **Next** . If you select **Reverse Incremental Migration** but do not specify the configurl, username, or password for the destination OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears to remind you to set the required parameters. For more information, see [Add an OceanBase Community Edition data source](../../300.manage-data-sources/100.add-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you set the required parameters, click **Test Connectivity** . After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next** and select the migration objects and migration scope on the **Select Objects** page.

   You can select one of the following two modes to migrate objects: **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules**.

   * Select **Specify Objects** . Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

     **Notice**

     * The name of a table to be migrated and the names of columns in the table must not contain Chinese characters.

     * If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project.

     When you migrate data from a TiDB database to an OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single or all objects to be migrated.

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If the precheck fails, identify the cause, fix the problem, and run the precheck again until it succeeds. You can modify the system configurations to skip a precheck item.

10. Click **Start Task** to start tasks of the project, such as schema migration and full migration.

    If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed. For more information, see [View details of a data migration project](../400.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md).

## Start a data migration project

You can start a data migration project only after it passes all check items. If any check item fails, fix the problem and perform the check again. After the data migration project is started, the tasks of the selected migration types are executed in sequence:

1. Schema migration

   The definitions of data objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views, are migrated from the source database to the destination OceanBase database. Temporary tables are automatically filtered out.

   If the source database is not an OceanBase database, OMS Community Edition performs format conversion and encapsulation based on the syntax definition and standard of the tenant type of the destination OceanBase database and then replicates the data to the destination OceanBase database.

   You can view the migration progress of tables and views and perform the following operations on the target object:

   * **View Creation Syntax**: View table creation syntax and modify index creation syntax.

     Fully compatible DDL syntax executed on the OBServer is displayed. Incompatible syntax is converted before it is displayed.

   * **Modify the creation syntax and try again**: Check the error information, check and modify the definition of the conversion result of a failed DDL statement, and then migrate the data to the destination again.

   * **View Database Return Code**: View the DDL statements executed on the OBServer and the execution error information of a failed schema migration task.

   * **Retry** / **Retry All Failed Objects**: You can retry failed schema migration tasks one by one or retry all failed tasks at a time.

   * **Skip** / **Batch Skip**: You can skip failed schema migration tasks one by one or skip multiple failed tasks at a time. To skip multiple objects at a time, click **Batch Skip** in the upper-right corner. When you skip an object, its index is also skipped. When you skip a table, you need to manually specify the DDL operations to be skipped in the destination database.

   * **Remove** / **Batch Remove**: You can remove failed schema migration tasks one by one or remove multiple failed tasks at a time. To remove multiple failed tasks at a time, click **Batch Remove** in the upper-right corner. When you remove an object, its index is also removed.

2. Full migration

   The migration of inventory data from tables in the source database to corresponding tables in the OceanBase database. On the **Full Migration** page, you can view **Tables**, **Table Indexes**, and **Full Load Performance**. The status of the full migration changes to Completed only after migration of the table objects and table indexes is completed.

   * On the **Tables** tab, you can view the names, source and destination databases, estimated data volume, migrated data volume, and status of tables.

   * On the **Table Indexes** tab, you can view the table objects, source and destination databases, creation time, end time, time consumed, and status. You can click **View Creation Syntax** in the Actions column of the object to view the creation syntax of the index.

   * On the **Full Load Performance** tab, you can view the graphs of records per second (RPS) and migration traffic of the source and the destination to understand the data migration conditions in a timely manner.

   You can combine full migration with incremental synchronization to ensure data consistency between the source and destination databases. If any objects failed to be migrated during a full migration, the causes of the failure are displayed.

   >**Notice:**
   >
   >If you do not select **Schema Migration** for **Migration Type** , OMS Community Edition migrates the fields in the source database that match those in the destination database during full migration, without checking whether the table structures are consistent.

   After full migration has completed and the subsequent step has started, you are not allowed to click **Rerun** behind Checker on the page displayed after you choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Component** \> **Checker**.

3. Incremental synchronization

   The synchronization of changed data in the source database to the corresponding tables in the destination OceanBase database.

   When services are continuously writing data to the source database, OMS Community Edition starts the incremental data pull module to pull incremental data from the source instance, parses and encapsulates the incremental data, and then stores the data in OMS Community Edition, before it starts the full data synchronization.

   After a full migration task is completed, OMS Community Edition starts the incremental data replay module to pull incremental data from the incremental data pull module. The incremental data is synchronized to the destination instance after it is filtered, mapped, and converted.

   In the incremental synchronization section, you can view the performance metrics of the incremental synchronization project, such as the migration latency, synchronization timestamp, and migration traffic.

   If the data migration project is in the **Paused** or **Failed** state, you can modify the **Current Timestamp** parameter. Note that you cannot select a timestamp after the current time when you modify the incremental synchronization timestamp. In addition, data may be duplicated or lost after you modify the incremental synchronization timestamp. Proceed with caution.

4. Full verification

   After the full data migration and incremental data migration are completed, OMS Community Edition automatically initiates a full data verification task to verify the data tables in the source database and the tables in the destination database.

   >**Notice:**
   >
   >If you do not select **Schema Migration** for **Migration Type** , OMS Community Edition verifies the fields in the source database that match those in the destination database during full verification, without checking whether the table structures are consistent.

   During full verification, a `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, or `RENAME` operation on tables in the source database may end the full verification.

   OMS Community Edition also provides corresponding APIs for you to initiate custom data verification tasks during incremental data synchronization.

   On the **Full Verification** page, you can view the overall status, start time, end time, total consumed time, estimated total number of rows, number of migrated rows, real-time traffic, and RPS of the full verification.

   The **Full Verification** page contains the **Verified Objects** and **Verification Performance** tabs.

   * On the **Verified Objects** tab, you can view the verification progress and verification object list.

     * You can view the names, source and destination databases, full data verification progress and results, and result summary of all migration objects.

     * You can filter migration objects by source or destination database.

     * You can select **View Completed Objects Only** to view basic information (such as the name) of objects that have completed schema migration.

     * You can choose **Re-verify** \> **Restart Full Verification** to run a full verification again for all migration objects.

     * For tables with inconsistent verification results:

       If you need to reverify all data in the tables, choose **Re-verify** \> **Reverify Abnormal Table**.

       If you only need to reverify inconsistent data, choose **Re-verify** \> **Verify Inconsistent Objects**.

       >**Notice:**
       >
       >The correction operation is not supported if the source database has no corresponding data.

   * On the **Verification Performance** tab, you can view the graphs of records per second (RPS) and migration traffic of the source and the destination to understand the data verification conditions in a timely manner.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to skip full verification for a project that is being verified or has failed verification. On the **Full Verification** page, click **Skip Full Verification**. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   After the full verification is completed, you can click **Go To Next Stage** to start the forward switchover. After you enter the switchover process, you cannot recheck the current verification task for data comparison or correction.

5. Forward switchover

   Forward switchover is the abstraction and standardization of the conventional system cutover process, a type of switchover that does not operate business application connections, and a task flow that needs to be executed before and after the data migration link of OMS Community Edition is used for application switchover. You need to make sure that the entire forward switchover process is completed before the application connections are switched over to OceanBase Database.

   Forward switchover will be included if you choose to perform data migration. You need to terminate forward incremental synchronization, delete the additional columns and unique indexes that the migration depends on, add the filtered CHECK constraint, and activate the triggers and foreign keys in the destination database to ensure the data integrity and availability of the destination database.

   If reverse incremental migration is configured, the subtasks for starting reverse incremental migration and disabling triggers and foreign keys in the source database are included in the forward switchover process to start real-time incremental synchronization from the destination database to the source database.

   1. Start forward switchover

      In this step, the migration does not stop. You only need to confirm the switchover process that is about to start. To start the forward switchover task, click **Start Forward Switchover**.

      >**Notice:**
      >
      >Before you start a forward switchover task, make sure that the source data source is about to stop writing or has stopped writing.

   2. Perform switchover precheck

      Check whether the current project status supports switchover. The precheck involves the following steps:

      * Check the synchronization latency: If the synchronization latency is within 15 seconds after incremental synchronization is started, the switchover passes this check item. If incremental synchronization is not started, the switchover automatically passes this check item.

      * Check the user write privilege on the source side.

      If the switchover passes the precheck, the system automatically performs the next step. If the switchover fails the precheck, the system shows the error details.

      In this case, you can retry or skip the precheck.

      After you click **Skip**, you need to click **Skip** again in the dialog box that appears.

   3. Start the destination Store

      Start incremental data pulling in the destination database. Create and start a destination Store. If the start fails, you can choose to click **Retry** or **Skip**.

   4. Confirm that writing has stopped in the source database

      In the **Confirm Writing Stopped at Source** section, click **OK** to make sure that no incremental data is generated in the source database.

   5. Confirm the writing stop timestamp upon synchronization completion

      OMS Community Edition automatically checks whether the source and destination databases are synchronized to the same timestamp. After the check is completed, the latency and timestamp of the incremental synchronization are displayed.

   6. Stop forward synchronization

      Stop the JDBCWriter from the source database to the destination database. If the forward synchronization fails to be stopped, you can choose to click **Retry** or **Skip**.

   7. Process database objects

      In this step, the database objects are migrated, the additional columns and indexes added by OMS Community Edition are deleted, and the constraints that are automatically ignored during the schema migration are added. You also need to confirm that objects such as triggers and sequences have been manually migrated, and that the triggers and foreign keys of the source are disabled.

      You need to click **Run** to process the database objects. For a running project, the **View Logs** and **Skip** options are provided in the Actions column. For manually handled projects, you need to click **Mark as Complete** . After all projects have been marked as completed, proceed to the next step.

   8. Start reverse incremental migration

      In the **Start Reverse Incremental Migration** section, click **Start Reverse Incremental Migration** to start the JDBCWriter from the destination database to the source database. Wait until the **Successfully started reverse increment** message appears.

6. After reverse incremental migration is started, click the **Reverse Incremental Migration** tab to view detailed information such as **Start Time** and **Reverse Synchronization Performance**.

   Performance metrics of reverse incremental migration include:

   * Latency: The time consumed to synchronize changed incremental data from the destination database to the source database in the unit of seconds.

   * Migration traffic: The traffic throughput of incremental data synchronization from the destination database to the source database in the unit of KB/s.
