# Create an active-active disaster recovery project in OceanBase database Community Edition

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to migrate data between the same type of tenants in OceanBase Database across regions and create active-active disaster recovery projects.

## Background

As more users apply OMS Community Edition in data migration, OMS Community Edition must adapt to increasingly diverse scenarios. In addition to single-region data migration and data synchronization, OMS Community Edition supports data migration across regions and active-active data synchronization between remote cities.

OMS Community Edition supports the following active-active disaster recovery scenarios:

* Local data migration and synchronization

* Local primary/standby disaster recovery

* Local active-active disaster recovery

* Remote data migration and synchronization

* Remote primary/standby disaster recovery

* Remote active-active disaster recovery

Primary/standby disaster recovery is common in scenarios with data disaster recovery requirements. You can create a real-time synchronization link between the primary and standby IDCs based on OMS Community Edition. When the primary IDC encounters disasters or downtime, business can be switched to the standby IDC to avoid business interruption.

However, primary/standby disaster recovery causes a waste of resources in the standby IDC. Therefore, OMS Community Edition provides an active-active solution to allow two IDCs to share business traffic.

When you migrate data between tenants of OceanBase Database in an active-active disaster recovery scenario, no forward switchover is performed, and you can enable DDL parameters only for one link.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a corresponding schema in the destination tenant of OceanBase Database. OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate tables and columns. Therefore, you must create a corresponding schema in the destination database before migration.

* You have created dedicated database users for data migration in the source and destination OceanBase databases, and granted corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../../200.users-and-privileges/100.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limits

* OMS Community Edition V3.2.0 and later versions allow you to create active-active disaster recovery links. However, you can migrate only tables with primary keys (including tables that contain the `pk` and `not null uk` fields) through active-active disaster recovery links.

* When you create an active-active disaster recovery link, you cannot select reverse incremental migration.

* If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

* You can migrate multiple schemas in a data migration project. The migration granularity ranges from a table to a tenant.

* You can migrate data from OceanBase Database V2.1.0 or later versions. The source and destination tenants can be created in different versions of OceanBase Database.

* If the character set used by the source database is UTF-8, we recommend that you use UTF-8 or a greater character set for the destination database.

* When you migrate data from OceanBase Database V1.4.x, OMS Community Edition does not support primary keys that contain data of the FLOAT or DOUBLE type.

* You must create a forward link and a reverse link to form an active-active disaster recovery link, which does not support triggers.

* You can enable synchronization of DDL operations for incremental migration in either the forward or reverse link.

* In an active-active disaster recovery project in OceanBase Database, when the database is of a version earlier than V3.2.x and contains a multi-partition table that has global unique indexes, if you update the value of a partitioning key of the table, data may be lost during migration.

Otherwise, data migration may be interrupted.   </ul> |
   | Full Verification           | <ul><li>If you select **Full Verification** , we recommend that you collect the statistics of both the source and destination OceanBase databases before full verification.   <li> If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but do not select all DML operations in the DML for Data Change section, you cannot select **Full Verification** .  </ul>                                                                             |

6. (Optional) Click **Next**.

   Specify related information for the source OceanBase database.

   * For incremental synchronization, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password.

   * For schema migration, specify the username and password.

   * For the migration of a table without a unique key, specify the password of `_OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER`.

   If you select **Scheme Migration** or **Incremental Synchronization** but no related parameters are configured for the data source of the source database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Add an OceanBase Community Edition data source](../../300.manage-data-sources/100.add-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you set the required parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next**. On the **Select Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   Select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules**. If you select **DDL for Schema Change**, only the **Match Rules** option is available.

   * Select **Specify Objects** . Then, select the objects to be migrated on the left, and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

     **Notice**

     * The name of a table to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the table, must not contain Chinese characters.

     * If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project.

     When you migrate data between OceanBase databases, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single object or all objects to be migrated.
