oms_migration_delay 
========================================



Impact on the system 
-----------------------------------------

This alert affects the real-time performance in incremental data migration and reverse data migration. If this alert is left unhandled for a long time, the migration task cannot be recovered.

Possible causes 
------------------------------------

* The source or destination database is not properly configured.

  

* Privileges are not properly assigned.

  

* The network is disconnected.

  

* Other special circumstances have occurred.

  




Solution 
-----------------------------

Go to the details page of the data migration project, and choose **...** \> **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner to view the timestamp information of the Store and JDBCWriter components. 

![Component monitoring](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/1428355261/p282025.png)

* If the Store component has a large delay, check its logs to check whether an error or exception has occurred.

  

* If the timestamp information of the Store component is basically in real time but the JDBCWriter component has a large delay, check the logs of the JDBCWriter component to check whether an error or exception has occurred.

  

* If no specific error message is found, feed back the phenomenon and component logs to technical support engineers of OMS.
