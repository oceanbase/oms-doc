# User management

By default, you can log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) console as the admin user. Letters in the username are not case-sensitive. OMS allows you to assign different roles to users. This topic describes how to manage users.

## Background information

**Notice:**

You can perform the following operations only as the admin user.

The left-side navigation pane of the OMS console provides the following tabs: **Overview**, **Data Migration**, **Data Synchronization**, **Data Source Management**, **O\&M and Monitoring**, and **System Management**. The supported roles are Admin and User. The following sections describe role privileges:

* Admin

  OMS supports the admin account of the Admin role and non-admin accounts of the Admin role.

  * The admin account of the Admin role

    The admin account is created in OMS by default, and has the following privileges:

    * Creates users of the Admin role.

    * Accesses all tabs in the left-side navigation pane of the OMS console.

    * Edits users, changes the password of each user, views tasks, and performs O\&M and monitoring operations.

    * Deletes all other users.

  * Non-admin accounts of the Admin role

    A non-admin account has the Admin role but its username is not admin. A non-admin account has the following features:

    * Has the privilege to edit the user information for the account.

    * Has the privilege to view the information of other users.

    * Has the privilege to create accounts of the User role, but not the Admin role.
