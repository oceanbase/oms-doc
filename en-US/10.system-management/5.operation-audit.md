# Operation audit

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) supports operation audit. This topic describes how to view and download operation audit records, and set the retention period of operation audit records on the operation audit page as the admin user.

## Background

On the **System Parameters** page, you can enable or disable operation audit by using the `operation_audit_log.enable` parameter. After operation audit is enabled, when an operation of the type supported by operation audit is performed, an operation record is automatically generated on the operation audit page. You can view and download operation audit records and set the retention period of operation audit records on the operation audit page. The operation audit feature can help you meet the security compliance requirements and trace the operations performed in OMS to identify the specific operators.

## Limits

Only the admin user can view the information on the operation audit page and perform related operations. Common users cannot access the operation audit page.

## View operation audit records

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Operation Audit**.

3. On the **Audits** page, view information such as the operation target, operation type, log type, and risk level. You can filter the content to view and click **View Details** in the Actions column.

   The following table describes the scope of records that you can query on the operation audit page.
