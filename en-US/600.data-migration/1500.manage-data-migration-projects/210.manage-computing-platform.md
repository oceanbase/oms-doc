# Manage computing platforms

When you use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from HBase to OBKV, the Checker-Full and Incr-Sync components can run on computing platforms. This topic describes how to create, edit, and delete computing platforms.

## Prerequisites

You have obtained the values of the following parameters of Flink.

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------|--------------------|
| jobmanager.rpc.address | The address of the JobManager.  |
| jobmanager.rpc.port | The port of the JobManager.  |
| rest.port | The RESTful service port.  |
| rest.address | The RESTful service address. This parameter is optional. By default, the value is consistent with that of `jobmanager.rpc.address`.  |

## Create a computing platform

1. Create a project to migrate data from HBase to OBKV and configure the project until the **Migration Options** step.

   For more information, see [Migrate data from HBase to OBKV](../400.create-a-project-to-migrate-data-from-hbase-to-obkv.md).

2. In the **Full Migration** or **Incremental Synchronization** section, click **Manage Computing Platform** in the **Computing Platform** drop-down list.

3. In the **Manage Computing Platform** dialog box, click **New Computing Platform** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **New Computing Platform** dialog box, configure the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-------------|-------------------|
   | Computing Platform Name | The name of the computing platform to create.  |
   | Computing Platform Type | The type of the computing platform. At present, only **FLINK** is supported.  |
   | Parameter Configuration | By default, the required computing platform parameters are displayed. For more information, see the parameter description in the Prerequisites section.  |
   | Config File | The configuration file of the source HBase cluster, which is named `hbase-site.xml` and located in the /lib/hbase/conf directory.  |
   | Remarks (Optional) | Additional information about the computing platform.  |

5. Click **Test Connection**.

6. After the test is passed, click **Create**.

## Edit a computing platform

1. Go to the **Manage Computing Platform** dialog box, find the target computing platform, and then click **Edit** next to it.

2. In the **Edit Computing Platform** dialog box, modify parameters as needed.

3. Click **Test Connection**.

4. After the test is passed, click **Create**.

## Delete a computing platform

Go to the **Manage Computing Platform** dialog box, find the target computing platform that is no longer required, and then click **Delete** next to it.
