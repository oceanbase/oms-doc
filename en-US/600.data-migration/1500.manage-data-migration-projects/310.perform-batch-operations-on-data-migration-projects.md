# Perform batch operations on data migration projects

This topic describes how to perform batch operations on data migration projects by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition. 

## Background

OMS Community Edition allows you to perform operations on multiple data migration projects at a time on the **Migration Projects** page. Supported batch operations on data migration projects vary based on the project states.

| **Project status** | **Supported batch operation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Batch start forward switchover

OMS Community Edition allows you to batch start forward switchover on data migration projects that are in **Running** state and in the same step of the forward switchover stage, except for the switchover precheck step.

Forward switchover consists of the following steps: start forward switchover, perform switchover precheck, start the destination Store, confirm that writing has stopped in the source, confirm the writing stop timestamp upon synchronization completion, stop forward synchronization, process database objects, and start reverse incremental migration.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
 <h4>Note</h4>
 <p>The steps of forward switchover vary based on the migration type specified when you created the project. </p>
</main>

1. On the **Migration Projects** page, select the data migration projects to batch start forward switchover.

2. Click **Batch Start Forward Switchover** in the lower part of the page.

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   This dialog box will display the number of projects that support this batch operation, the project names, and the latest timestamps.

4. In the **Batch Start Forward Switchover** dialog box, view the status of the forward switchover task.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>You must manually confirm the following steps: start a forward switchover task, verify that writing is stopped at the source, process database objects, and start reverse incremental migration. </p>
   </main>

5. After the operation succeeds, the number of projects that succeeded in this batch operation is displayed.

   For any project that failed the batch operation, troubleshoot the issue as prompted.

## Batch start

OMS Community Edition allows you to batch start data migration projects in the **Not Started** state.

1. On the **Migration Projects** page, select the data migration projects for batch start.

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   This dialog box will display the number of projects that support batch start, the project names, and the latest timestamps.

4. After the operation succeeds, the number of projects that are successfully started is displayed.

   For any project that failed the batch operation, troubleshoot the issue as prompted.

## Batch delete

OMS Community Edition allows you to batch delete data migration projects in the **Not Started** or **Released** state.

1. On the **Migration Projects** page, select the data migration projects for batch deletion.

2. Choose **More Batch Operations** > **Batch Delete** in the lower part of the page.

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   This dialog box will display the number of projects that support batch deletion, the project names, and the latest timestamps.

4. After the operation succeeds, the number of projects that are successfully deleted is displayed.

   For any project that failed the batch operation, troubleshoot the issue as prompted.

## Batch enter forward switchover stage

OMS Community Edition allows you to enable multiple data migration projects that are in the **Running** state and have completed full verification to enter the forward switchover stage.

![batch-enter-forward-en](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/oms/oms-enterprise/batch-enter-forward-en.png)

1. On the **Migration Projects** page, select the data migration projects to enter the forward switchover stage.

2. In the lower part of the page, choose **More Batch Operations** > **Batch Enter Forward Switchover**.

3. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   This dialog box will display the number of projects that can enter the forward switchover stage, the project names, and the latest timestamps.

4. After the operation succeeds, the number of projects that succeeded in the batch operation is displayed.

   For any project that failed the batch operation, troubleshoot the issue as prompted.

## Batch modify alert configuration

OMS Community Edition allows you to batch modify the alert configuration of data migration projects in the **Not Started**, **Running**, **Paused**, or **Failed** state.

1. On the **Migration Projects** page, select the data migration projects whose alert settings are to be modified.

2. Choose **More Batch Operations** > **Batch Modify Alert Configuration** in the lower part of the page.

3. In the **Batch Configure Alerts** dialog box, specify the related parameters.

   ![batch-modify-alert-en](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/oms/oms-enterprise/batch-modify-alert-en.png)
