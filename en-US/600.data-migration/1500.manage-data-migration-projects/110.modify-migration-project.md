# Change the name of a data migration project

This topic describes how to change the name of a data migration project in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Limitations

* OMS Community Edition allows you to change the name of a data migration project in the **Not Started**, **Running**, **Paused**, or **Failed** state.

* If you have created a sub-project to modify the migration objects during the running of a data migration project, you cannot change the project name. For more information about how to modify the migration objects, see [View and modify migration objects](../1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md).

* The project name is a unique identifier for a project of a user.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

3. On the **Migration Projects** page, click the **Edit** icon next to the name of the target project.
