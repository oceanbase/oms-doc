# Migrate data from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition.

## Background information

You can create a data migration project in the console of OMS Community Edition to seamlessly migrate the existing business data and incremental data from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

The PostgreSQL database supports the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode.

| Type | Supported operations |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | Schema migration, full migration, and full verification |
| Primary/standby databases | Primary database: incremental synchronization and reverse incremental migration<br>Standby database: schema migration, full migration, and full verification |

## Prerequisites

* You have created a corresponding schema in OceanBase Database Community Edition that serves as the destination. OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate tables and columns. Therefore, you must create a corresponding schema in the destination database before the migration.

* You have created dedicated database users for data migration in the source PostgreSQL database and OceanBase Database Community Edition that serves as the destination, and granted corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limitations

* **Limitations on the source database**

   **Do not perform DDL operations for database or schema changes during schema migration or full data migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.**

* Only PostgreSQL 10.x and 12.x are supported.

* OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate tables with primary keys and tables with NOT NULL unique keys from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* When you use OMS Community Edition to migrate data from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition, DDL synchronization is not supported.

* If the destination is a database, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database. If triggers exist in the destination database, the data migration may fail.

* When you migrate partitioned tables from a PostgreSQL database, note the following limits:

  * The parent table and child table must have the same schema.

  * The parent table and child table must have the same primary key columns, NOT NULL unique key columns, and partitioning key columns, or the primary key columns or NOT NULL unique key columns must include the partitioning key columns.

  * The primary keys or NOT NULL unique keys must be unique in the parent table.

* `REPLICA IDENTITY` must be set to FULL for all parent tables and child tables to be migrated from the PostgreSQL database.

  * If `REPLICA IDENTITY` is not set to FULL, the operation to update or delete the business data may fail.

  * If you use a wildcard to specify the migration objects, the PostgreSQL database must subscribe to all tables in the selected database, including the selected tables, unselected tables, and new tables. `REPLICA IDENTITY` must be set to FULL for all parent tables, otherwise the operation to update or delete the business data may fail.

* OMS Community Edition does not support the migration of unlogged tables and temporary tables in the PostgreSQL database.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition supports the migration of only objects whose database name, table name, and column name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are line breaks and . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / &

## Considerations

* In the reverse incremental data migration from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition, if OceanBase Database Community Edition is of a version earlier than V3.2.x and contains a multi-partition table that has a globally unique index, data may be lost during migration if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

* If you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the Incr-Sync component. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization or reverse incremental migration.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* If you want to aggregate multiple tables:

  * We recommend that you configure the mappings between the source and destination databases by importing objects or specifying matching rules.

  * We recommend that you manually create schemas at the destination. If you use OMS Community Edition to create schemas, skip failed objects in the schema migration step.

* A difference between the source and destination table schemas may result in data consistency. Some known scenarios are described as follows:

  * When you manually create a table schema, if the data type of a column in the source is not supported by OMS Community Edition, implicit data type conversion may occur, which causes inconsistent column types between the source and destination.

  * If the length of a column in the destination is shorter than that in the source, the data of this column is automatically truncated, which causes data inconsistency between the source and destination.

## Procedure

1. Create a data migration project.

   1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Tag | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a PostgreSQL data source, select it from the drop-down list. If not, click **New Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create a PostgreSQL data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/900.create-a-pg-data-source.md). <br>You can select a PostgreSQL data source in primary database only mode or primary/standby databases mode. This topic describes how to create a data migration project with a PostgreSQL data source in primary/standby databases mode.  |
   | Destination | If you have created a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, select it from the drop-down list. If not, click **New Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |

3. Click **Next**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   Note that this project supports only tables with a primary key or a non-null unique index and other tables are automatically filtered out.

5. On the **Select Migration Type** page, configure the parameters.

   Options for **Migration Type** are **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Description |
   |------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | The definitions of data objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views, are migrated from the source database to the destination database. Temporary tables are automatically filtered out.  |
   | Full Migration | The existing data is migrated from tables in the source database to the corresponding tables in the destination database. If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics of the PostgreSQL database before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Changed data in the source database is synchronized to the corresponding tables in the destination database after an incremental synchronization task starts. Data changes are data addition, modification, and deletion. <br>Options for **DML Synchronization** in the **Incremental Synchronization** section include `Insert`, `Delete`, and `Update`. For more information, see [DML filtering](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/100.migration-dml.md). <br>OMS Community Edition automatically creates publications and slots for incremental synchronization from a PostgreSQL database. However, you need to monitor the usage of the disk for storing archive files. By default, OMS Community Edition instructs the database to update the `confirmed_flush_lsn` value of a slot every 10 minutes. The interval can be customized. By default, archive files need to be retained for 48 hours. Therefore, OMS instructs the database to clean up only archived logs that have been retained for more than 48 hours. The retention period can be customized. <br>If the archive logs cannot be cleared during the migration because slots exist, you need to destroy the data migration project and then clear the archive logs.  |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of both the source and destination databases before full verification. For more information about how to collect statistics of OceanBase Database Community Edition, see [Manually collect statistics](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-10000000001699693).   <li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but do not select all DML operations in the **DML Synchronization** section, you cannot select **Full Verification**. <li>OMS Community Edition supports full data verification of only tables with a unique key. </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | Data changes made in the destination database after the business database switchover are applied to the source database in real time. You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li>Multi-table aggregation and synchronization is enabled.   <li>Multiple source schemas map to the same destination schema.  |

6. (Optional) Click **Next**. If you have selected **Reverse Incremental Migration** but the ConfigUrl, username, or password is not configured for OceanBase Database Community Edition that serves as the destination, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information about parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules** to specify the migration objects.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>The names of tables to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the tables, must not contain Chinese characters. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project. </p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      When you migrate data from a PostgreSQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects from text, rename objects, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single migration object or all migration objects.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | OMS Community Edition allows you to rename migration objects. For more information, see [Rename a database table](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/500.db-table-rename.md).  |
      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to filter rows by using `WHERE` conditions. For more information, see [Use SQL conditions to filter data](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/600.migration-row-filters.md). <br>You can also view column information of the migration object in the **View Column** section.  |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single object or all objects to be migrated to the destination database during data mapping.  <ul><li>To remove a single migration object:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**.   <li> To remove all migration objects:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.   </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/300.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

8. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   To view or modify parameters of the Full-Import or Incr-Sync component, click **Configuration Details** in the upper-right corner of the **Full Migration** or **Incremental Synchronization** section. For more information about the parameters, see [Coordinator](../1100.o-m-guide/500.component-parameters/100.coordinator.md).

   * Full migration

      The following table describes the full migration parameters, which are displayed only when you have selected **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |----|----------------------------------|
      | Concurrency Speed | Valid values: **Stable**, **Normal**, **Fast**, and **Custom**. The amount of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance. If you select **Custom**, you can set **Read Concurrency**, **Write Concurrency**, and **JVM Memory** as needed.  |
      | Processing Strategy When Records Exist in Target Object | Valid values: **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, when the data to be inserted conflicts with the existing data of a destination table, OMS Community Edition retains the existing data and records the conflict data. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>If you select <b>Ignore</b>, data is pulled in IN mode for verification. In this case, the scenario where the destination table contains more data than the source table cannot be verified, and the verification efficiency will be decreased. </p></main></li><li>If you select **Stop Migration** and a destination table contains records, an error is returned during full migration, indicating that the migration is not allowed. In this case, you must clear the data in the destination table before you can continue with the migration. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>After an error is returned, if you click **Resume** in the dialog box, OMS Community Edition ignores this error and continues to migrate data. Proceed with caution. </p></main></li> </ul> |
      | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | Specifies whether to create indexes after the full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time required for full migration. For more information about the considerations on post-indexing, see the description below. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>This feature is supported only when you have selected both <b>Schema Migration</b> and <b>Full Migration</b> on the <b>Select Migration Type</b> page. </p> </main> |

      If post-indexing is allowed, we recommend that you adjust the parameters based on the hardware conditions of the destination database and the business traffic.

      * If you use OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.x, adjust the following parameters of the sys tenant and business tenants by using a command-line interface (CLI) client.

         * Adjust the parameters of the sys tenant

            ```sql
            // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each server. 
            // To maximize performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than, for example, 1.5 times, the number of physical CPU cores. In addition, make sure that the value does not exceed 64, to prevent database kernels from contending for locks. 
            set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
            ```

         * Adjust the parameters of a business tenant

            ```sql
            // Specify the limit on the file memory buffer size.
            alter system set _temporary_file_io_area_size = '10' tenant = 'xxx'; 
            // Disable throttling in V4.x.
            alter system set sys_bkgd_net_percentage = 100;  
            ```

      * If you use OceanBase Database Community Edition V3.x, adjust the following parameters of the sys tenant by using a CLI client.

         ```sql
         // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each server. 
         // To maximize performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than, for example, 1.5 times, the number of physical CPU cores. In addition, make sure that the value does not exceed 64, to prevent database kernels from contending for locks. 
         set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
         // data_copy_concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent data migration and replication tasks allowed in the system. 
         alter system set data_copy_concurrency = 200; 
         ```

   * Incremental synchronization

      The following table describes the incremental synchronization parameters, which are displayed only when you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** on the **Select Migration Type** page.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |----|----------------------------------|
      | Concurrency Speed | Valid values: **Stable**, **Normal**, **Fast**, and **Custom**. The amount of resources to be consumed by an incremental synchronization task varies based on the synchronization performance. If you select **Custom**, you can set **Read Concurrency**, **Write Concurrency**, and **JVM Memory** as needed.  |
      | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have set the migration type to **Full Migration**, this parameter is not displayed.    <li> If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but not **Full Migration**, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. For more information, see [Set an incremental synchronization timestamp](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/1000.incremental-synchronization-timestamp.md).  |
      | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period results in more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connectivity of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the **Actions** column of the failed precheck item. A dialog box appears, prompting you the impact. If you want to skip this operation, click **OK**.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects when the migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration subtasks will be executed based on the selected migration types. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.
