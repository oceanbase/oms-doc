# Change the length of a constrained column

This topic describes incompatibilities between MySQL databases and MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database when you change the length of a constrained column. The incompatibilities vary depending on the constraint.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>In the following tables, an empty cell in the type column indicates that the type is not supported by the corresponding constraint, and a hyphen (-) means N/A. </p>
