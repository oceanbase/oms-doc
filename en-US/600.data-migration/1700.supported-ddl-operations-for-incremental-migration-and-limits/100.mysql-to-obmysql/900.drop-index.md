# DROP INDEX

This topic describes the supported conversion scope of DROP INDEX DDL operations during data migration from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database.

## Syntax

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) supports the synchronization of the `DROP INDEX` statements.

```sql
DROP INDEX index_name ON tbl_name
    [algorithm_option | lock_option] ...

algorithm_option:
    ALGORITHM [=] {DEFAULT | INPLACE | COPY}

lock_option:
    LOCK [=] {DEFAULT | NONE | SHARED | EXCLUSIVE}
```

## Ignored clauses and options

  <main id="notice" type='alert'>
    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <p>The following clauses and options will be ignored and will not be resolved or converted when they are specified in the synchronized DDL statements. </p>
  </main>

* ALGORITHM = DEFAULT | INPLACE | COPY

* LOCK = DEFAULT | NONE | SHARED | EXCLUSIVE
