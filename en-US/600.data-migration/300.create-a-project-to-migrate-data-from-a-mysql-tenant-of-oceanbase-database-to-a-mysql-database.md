# Migrate data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a MySQL database

This topic describes how to migrate data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a MySQL database by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Background information

You can create a data migration project in the OMS Community Edition console to migrate the existing business data and incremental data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a MySQL database through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

MySQL databases support the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode.

| Mode | Supported Operation |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | A MySQL database in standby database only mode cannot serve as the destination for data migration. |
| Primary/standby databases | Primary database: schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, and reverse incremental migration<br>Standby database: full verification<br>**Note** When a data source in primary/standby databases mode is selected, OMS Community Edition uses the standby database as the primary node for full verification.  |

## Prerequisites

You have created dedicated database users for data migration in the source OceanBase database of Community Edition and destination MySQL database, and granted corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limitations

* Operation limitations on the source database

   Do not perform DDL operations for database or schema changes during schema migration and full data migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.

* OMS Community Edition supports the following MySQL database versions: 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0.

* OMS Community Edition does not support the migration of tables without primary keys from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a MySQL database.

* If the `lower_case_table_names` settings of the source database and destination database are different, the project cannot be created. When you migrate data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a MySQL database, object names are not case-sensitive. OMS Community Edition does not allow you to create a project when `lower_case_table_names` is set to 0 for the source database and destination database.

* OMS Community Edition does not support a primary key or unique key that contains data of both the FLOAT and BINARY types.

* OMS Community Edition does not support an index field greater than 767 bytes (or 191 characters) in length for MySQL 5.6.

* If the destination is a database, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database. If triggers exist in the destination database, the data migration may fail.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* If temporary tables exist in OceanBase Database Community Edition earlier than V4.0.0, full migration fails.

* OMS Community Edition supports the migration of only objects whose database name, table name, and column name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are line breaks and . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / &.

* OMS Community Edition does not support a standby OceanBase database as the source.

## Considerations

* We recommend that you enable log archiving in OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.x. After log archiving is enabled, OMS can still consume archived logs to implement incremental synchronization if clogs are recycled. For more information about how to enable log archiving, see [Log archiving](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community-observer-cn-10000000000901781).

* If the UTF-8 character set is used in the source, we recommend that you use a compatible character set, such as UTF-8 or UTF-16, in the destination to avoid garbled characters.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization or reverse incremental migration.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* During data migration from OceanBase Database Community Edition earlier than V3.2.x to a MySQL database, data loss may occur if you update the value of the partitioning key of a multi-partition table with a globally unique index.

* If the value of the `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp` variable in the source database is different from that in the destination database, data of the TIMESTAMP type may be inconsistent during verification.

* When DDL synchronization is disabled, if you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization component. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* Check whether the migration precision of OMS Community Edition for columns of data types such as DECIMAL, FLOAT, and DOUBLE is as expected. If the precision of the destination field type is lower than the precision of the source field type, the value with a higher precision may be truncated. This may result in data inconsistency between the source and destination fields.

* Timestamps supported by OceanBase Database Community Edition range from 0000-00-00 00:00:00.000000 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999. Timestamps supported by MySQL databases range from 1970-01-01 00:00:01.000000 to 2038-01-19 03:14:07.999999. When a timestamp not supported by the destination is written to the source, OMS Community Edition inserts this timestamp to the destination and writes it into the `error.log` file or the exception table.

* If you configure matching rules to select tables created by using the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement as migration objects, we recommend that you configure the rules, such as `a.*_2023_backup`, in advance to avoid interruption of the migration project.

* In a multi-table aggregation scenario:

  * We recommend that you map objects in the source and destination by importing objects and configuring matching rules.

  * We recommend that you manually create schemas in the destination. If you use OMS to create schemas, skip failed objects in the schema migration step.

* In a data migration project where the source type is OceanBase Database Community Edition and DDL synchronization is enabled, if a `RENAME` operation is performed on a table in the source, we recommend that you restart the project to avoid data loss during incremental synchronization.

* OMS Community Edition does not require the quantities of fields in the source database and destination database to be the same. During full migration or incremental synchronization, if an error table field in the source database does not exist in the destination database, you can set the `ignoreRedunantColumnsReplicate` parameter of the **Full-Import** or **Incr-Sync** component to `true` and then resume the data migration project.

## Procedure

1. Create a data migration project.

   1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | The name of the migration project. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. The name cannot contain spaces or exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Tag | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Destination | If you have created a MySQL data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a MySQL data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/200.create-a-mysql-data-source.md). <br>You can select a MySQL data source in primary database only mode or primary/standby databases mode. A MySQL data source in standby database only mode cannot serve as the destination for data migration. This topic describes how to create a data migration project with an Oracle data source in primary/standby databases mode.  |

3. Click **Next**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   Note that this project supports only tables with a primary key or a non-null unique index. Other tables and views are automatically filtered out.

5. On the **Select Migration Type** page, configure the related parameters.

   Options for **Migration Type** are **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Description |
   |------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | The definitions of data objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views, are migrated from the source database to the destination database. Temporary tables are automatically filtered out.  |
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you collect statistics on OceanBase Database Community Edition before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Options for **Incremental Synchronization** are [DML Synchronization](1600.migration-function-introduction/100.migration-dml.md) and [DDL Synchronization](1600.migration-function-introduction/200.migration-ddl.md). You can select the operations as needed. For more information about DDL synchronization, see [Supported DDL operations and limits for incremental migration from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL database](1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/200.obmysql-to-mysql.md). **Incremental Synchronization** has the following limitations: <ul><li> The standby MySQL database does not support **incremental synchronization**.     <li>If you select **DDL Synchronization**, when you perform a DDL operation that is not supported by OMS Community Edition in the source database, data migration may fail. <li>  If the DDL operation creates a new column, we recommend that you set the attribute of the column to Null. Otherwise, data migration may be interrupted. <li>If you insert columns without data during incremental synchronization, the previous data will be padded based on the current time, causing time inconsistency.  </ul> |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect statistics on OceanBase Database Community Edition and use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect statistics on the MySQL database before full verification    <li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but do not select all DML statements in the **DML Synchronization** section, you cannot select `Full Verification` in OMS Community Edition.      </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases:<ul><li> Multi-table aggregation and synchronization is enabled.    <li>Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.  </ul> |

6. (Optional) Click **Next**.

   Consider the following circumstances when the source database type is OceanBase Database Community Edition:

   * If incremental synchronization needs to be performed, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password.

   * If only schema migration needs to be performed, specify the username and password.

   If you select **Schema Migration** or **Incremental Synchronization** without configuring the required parameters for the source OceanBase database of Community Edition, the **More About Data Sources** dialog box appears to prompt you to configure the parameters. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules** to specify the migration objects.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>

      <h4>Notice</h4>

      <ul>

      <li>
         <p>The names of tables to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the tables, must not contain Chinese characters. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
         <p>If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
      <p>After you select migration objects by using the <b>Specify Objects</b> option, the DDL operations take effect only for the selected objects, and table creation is not supported. </p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      </main>

      OMS Community Edition also allows you to import objects from text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single object or all objects to be migrated.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | OMS Community Edition allows you to rename migration objects. For more information, see [Rename a database table](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/500.db-table-rename.md).  |
      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows. For more information, see [Use SQL conditions to filter data](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/600.migration-row-filters.md). <br>You can also view column information of the migration object in the **View Column** section.  |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single object or all objects to be migrated to the destination database during data mapping.  <ul><li>To remove a single migration object:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, move the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**.   <li> To remove all migration objects:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.   </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/300.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

8. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have set the migration type to **Full Migration**, this parameter is not displayed.    <li> If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but not **Full Migration**, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. For more information, see [Set an incremental synchronization timestamp](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/1000.incremental-synchronization-timestamp.md).  |
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Import component to customize the concurrency.  <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p> To enable this feature, select <b>Full Migration</b> on the <b>Select Migration Type</b> page. </p></main> |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Verification component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The period for which incremental parsed files are retained in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Processing Strategy When Destination Table Has Records | The processing strategy adopted when a destination table contains records. This parameter is displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page. Valid values: **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, the data in the source and destination databases may be inconsistent. </li><li>If you select **Stop Migration**, the project is set to the Failed state when the system detects records in the destination table. To continue data migration, manually resume the project. </li> |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | Specifies whether to create indexes after the full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time required for full migration. The considerations for post-indexing are described below the table. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>To enable this feature, select both <b>Schema Migration</b> and <b>Full Migration</b> on the <b>Select Migration Type</b> page. </p> </main> |

   If you enable post-indexing, we recommend that you modify the parameters based on the hardware conditions of the destination OceanBase database and the business traffic.

   * In OceanBase Database V4.x, modify the following sys and business tenant parameters by using a CLI client tool.

      * Modify sys tenant parameters

         ```sql
         // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
         // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
         set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
         ```

      * Modify business tenant parameters

         ```sql
         // The file memory buffer limit.
         alter system set _temporary_file_io_area_size = '10' tenant = 'xxx'; 
         // Disable throttling on OceanBase Database V4.x.
         alter system set sys_bkgd_net_percentage = 100;  
         ```

   * In OceanBase Database V3.x, modify the following sys tenant parameters by using a CLI client tool.

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // data_copy_concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent data migration and replication tasks allowed in the system. 
      alter system set data_copy_concurrency = 200; 
      ```

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the **precheck**, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the Actions column of the failed precheck item. A dialog box appears, prompting you the impact. If you want to skip this operation, click **OK**.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects of a migration project when the project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be processed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.
