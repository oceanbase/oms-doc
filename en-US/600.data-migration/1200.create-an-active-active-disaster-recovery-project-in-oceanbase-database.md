# Migrate data within OceanBase Community Edition in active-active disaster recovery scenarios

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to migrate data between tenants of the same type in OceanBase Database across regions and create active-active disaster recovery projects.

## Background

As more users apply OMS Community Edition in data migration, OMS Community Edition must adapt to increasingly diverse scenarios. In addition to single-region data migration and data synchronization, OMS Community Edition supports data migration across regions and active-active data synchronization between remote cities.

OMS Community Edition supports the following active-active disaster recovery scenarios:

* Local data migration and synchronization

* Local primary/standby disaster recovery

* Local active-active disaster recovery

* Remote data migration and synchronization

* Remote primary/standby disaster recovery

* Remote active-active disaster recovery

Primary/Standby disaster recovery is common in scenarios with data disaster recovery requirements. You can create a real-time data synchronization project between the primary and standby IDCs based on OMS Community Edition. When the primary IDC encounters disasters or downtime, the business can be switched to the standby IDC to avoid business interruption.

However, primary/standby disaster recovery causes a waste of resources in the standby IDC. Therefore, OMS Community Edition provides an active-active solution to allow two IDCs to share business traffic.

When you migrate data between tenants of OceanBase Database in an active-active disaster recovery scenario, no forward switchover is performed, and you can enable DDL parameters only for one link.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a corresponding schema in the destination tenant of OceanBase Database.

* You have created dedicated database users for data migration in the source and destination OceanBase databases, and granted corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limitations

* **Operation limitations on the source database**

   **Do not perform DDL operations on databases or tables during schema migration and full migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.**

* In an active-active disaster recovery project between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database, only tables with unique keys can be migrated.

* When you create an active-active disaster recovery project, you cannot select reverse incremental migration.

* If the destination data source is a database, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database. If triggers exist in the destination database, the data migration may fail.

* You must create a forward link and a reverse link to form an active-active disaster recovery link, which does not support triggers.

* You can enable DDL synchronization in either the forward or reverse link.

* In incremental synchronization scenarios, when `useTargetIndex = false`, if the destination database uses a field of the BINARY type as the primary key or unique key, and the length of the migrated data in the source database is inconsistent with the length of the BINARY field in the destination database, the UPDATE or DELETE operation cannot match the data, which may cause data quality risks.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition supports the synchronization of only objects whose database name and table name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / & \n

* If temporary tables exist in the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0.0, full migration fails.

* OMS Community Edition does not support data synchronization from a standby OceanBase database.

## Considerations

* If the UTF-8 character set is used in the source, we recommend that you use a compatible character set, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, in the destination to avoid garbled characters.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization or reverse incremental migration.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* In an active-active disaster recovery project in OceanBase Database, when the database is of a version earlier than V3.2.x and contains a multi-partition table that has global unique indexes, if you update the value of a partitioning key of the table, data may be lost during migration.

* Check whether the migration precision of OMS Community Edition is as expected for columns of data types such as DECIMAL, FLOAT, and DOUBLE. If the precision of the destination field type is lower than the precision of the source field type, the value with a higher precision may be truncated. This may result in data inconsistency between the source and destination fields.

* When DDL synchronization is disabled, if you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization component. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* If you configure matching rules to select tables created by using the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement as migration objects, we recommend that you configure the rules, such as `a.*_2023_backup`, in advance to avoid interruption of the migration project.

* In a multi-table aggregation scenario:

  * We recommend that you map objects in the source and destination databases by importing objects and configuring matching rules.

  * We recommend that you manually create schemas in the destination database. If you use OMS Community Edition to create schemas, skip failed objects in the schema migration step.

* In a data migration project in which the source is OceanBase Database and DDL synchronization is enabled, if a database or table in the source is renamed, we recommend that you restart the project to avoid data loss during incremental synchronization.

* When you migrate data from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to another MySQL tenant, by default, `lower_case_table_names` is set to 1 in the destination database, and the destination database objects are created with lowercase names.

   | Source | If you have created an OceanBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an Oracle data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md). |
   | Destination | If you have created an OceanBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an Oracle data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right.  |
   | Scenarios | Two scenarios are available: **Data Migration** and **Active-Active Disaster Recovery**. Select **Active-Active Disaster Recovery**.  <br>**Notice** <ul><li> The source and destination data sources must be tenants of the same type in OceanBase Database.   <li> The source and destination nodes must belong to different regions.  </ul> |

3. Click **Next**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   Note that this project supports only tables with a primary key or a non-null unique index and other tables and views are automatically filtered out.

5. On the **Select Migration Type** page, specify the related parameters.

   Migration types available for the forward link include **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, and **Full Verification**.

   | Migration type | Description |
   |------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | The definitions of data objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views, are migrated from the source database to the destination database. Temporary tables are automatically filtered out.  |
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of the source OceanBase database before the data migration.   |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Options for **Incremental Synchronization** are [DML Synchronization](1600.migration-function-introduction/100.migration-dml.md) and [DDL Synchronization](1600.migration-function-introduction/200.migration-ddl.md). You can select the operations as needed. For more information about DDL synchronization, see [DDL synchronization between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database](1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/800.obmysql-to-obmysql.md). **Incremental Synchronization** has the following limitations: <ul><li>You can enable DDL synchronization in either the forward or reverse link.   <li> If you select **DDL Synchronization**, when you perform a DDL operation that is not supported by OMS Community Edition in the source database, data migration may fail.    <li> If the DDL operation creates a new column, we recommend that you set the attribute of the column to Null. Otherwise, data migration may be interrupted.  </ul> |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of both the source and destination OceanBase databases before full verification.    <li> If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but did not select all DML statements in the **DML Synchronization** section, OMS Community Edition does not support full verification.   </ul> |

6. (Optional) Click **Next**.

   Specify the related information for the source OceanBase database.

   * For incremental synchronization, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password.

   * For schema migration, specify the username and password.

   * For the migration of a table without a unique key, specify the password of `_OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER`.

   If you have selected **Scheme Migration** or **Incremental Synchronization** but no related parameters are configured for the data source of the source database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

      </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      When you migrate data between OceanBase databases, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single object or all objects to be migrated.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | OMS Community Edition allows you to rename the migration objects. For more information, see [Rename a database table](1600.migration-function-introduction/500.db-table-rename.md).  |
      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows. For more information, see [Use SQL conditions to filter data](1600.migration-function-introduction/600.migration-row-filters.md) <br>You can also view column information of the migration object in the **View Column** section.  |
      | Remove/Remove All | During data mapping, OMS Community Edition allows you to remove one or more selected objects to be migrated to the destination.  <ul><li>To remove a single migration object:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**.   <li> To remove all migration objects:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**. </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](1600.migration-function-introduction/300.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

8. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have set the migration type to **Full Migration**, this parameter is not displayed.    <li> If you have selected a migration type other than **Full Migration**, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp.<br>  **Notice**<br>You can select the current time or a point in time earlier than the current time. This parameter is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp.   </ul> |
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Import component to customize the concurrency.  <br>**Notice**:<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Verification component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Processing Strategy When Destination Table Has Records | The processing strategy adopted when a destination table contains records. This parameter is displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page. Valid values: **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, the data in the source and destination databases may be inconsistent. </li><li>If you select **Stop Migration**, the project is set to the Failed state when the system detects records in the destination table. To continue data migration, manually resume the project. </li> |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | Specifies whether to create indexes after the full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time required for full migration. The considerations for post-indexing are described below the table. <br>**Notice**:<ul><li>To enable this feature, select both **Schema Migration** and **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  </li> <li>Only non-unique key indexes can be created after the migration is completed. </li><li>OceanBase Database V1.x does not support the post-indexing feature. </li></ul> |

   If you enable post-indexing, we recommend that you adjust the parameters based on the hardware conditions of the destination OceanBase database and the business traffic.

   * If you use OceanBase Database V4.x, use the CLI tool to adjust the following parameters for the business tenant:

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // The file memory buffer limit.
      alter system set _temporary_file_io_area_size = '10' tenant = 'xxx'; 
      // Disable throttling on OceanBase Database V4.x.
      alter system set sys_bkgd_net_percentage = 100;  
      ```

   * If you use OceanBase Database V2.x or V3.x, use the CLI tool to adjust the following parameters for the sys tenant:

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // data_copy_concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent data migration and replication tasks allowed in the system. 
      alter system set data_copy_concurrency = 200; 
      ```

9. Click **Precheck** to start a pre-check on the data migration project.

   During the pre-check, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the pre-check:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the pre-check again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the **Actions** column of a failed pre-check item. In the dialog box that appears, you can view the prompt for the consequences of the operation and click **OK**.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects when the data migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.

## Create a reverse link

You can create a reverse link only after the schema migration task on the forward link is completed.

1. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   </main>

6. (Optional) Click **Next**.

   For incremental synchronization, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password of the source database. For the migration of a table without a unique key, you need to specify the password of `_OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER`.

   If no related parameters are configured for the source database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   When you create a reverse link, OMS Community Edition also allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove one or all objects to be migrated. For more information, see the section that describes how to create a forward link.

8. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, specify the following parameters.
