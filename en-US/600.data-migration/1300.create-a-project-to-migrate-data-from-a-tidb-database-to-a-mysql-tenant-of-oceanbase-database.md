# Migrate data from a TiDB database to OceanBase Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database.

## Background

TiDB is an integrated distributed database that supports hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP). You must deploy a TiCDC cluster and a Kafka cluster to synchronize incremental data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database.

TiCDC is an incremental data synchronization tool for TiDB and provides high availability by using a placement driver (PD) cluster, which is the scheduling module of the TiDB cluster and usually consists of three PD nodes. TiKV Server is a TiKV node in the TiDB cluster. It sends data changes in change logs to the TiCDC cluster. TiCDC runs multiple TiCDC processes to obtain and process data from TiKV nodes, and then synchronizes the data to the Kafka cluster. The Kafka cluster saves the incremental logs of the TiDB database that are converted by TiCDC. During incremental data synchronization, the data transmission system obtains the corresponding data from the Kafka cluster and migrates the data to the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database in real time. If you create a TiDB data source without binding it to a Kafka data source, you cannot perform incremental synchronization.

## Limitations

* **Operation limitations on the source database**

   **Do not perform DDL operations on databases or tables during schema migration and full migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.**

* Only TiDB 4.x and 5.4 are supported.

* If the destination data source is a database, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database. If triggers exist in the destination database, the data migration may fail.

* OMS Community Edition does not support the migration of tables without primary keys or data with spaces from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition supports the synchronization of only objects whose database name and table name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / & \n

* OMS supports only the TiCDC Open Protocol. If you use an unsupported protocol, a JDBC-connector exception will occur, and an error that indicates a null pointer will be returned.

## Considerations

* If the UTF-8 character set is used in the source, we recommend that you use a compatible character set, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, in the destination to avoid garbled characters.

* During reverse incremental migration from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, if the MySQL tenant is of a version earlier than V3.2.x and contains a multi-partition table that has a globally unique index, data may be lost during migration if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

* Do not write data to the topic synchronously used by TiCDC. Otherwise, a JDBC-Connector exception may occur and a null pointer error may be returned.

* Check whether the migration precision of OMS Community Edition is as expected for columns of data types such as DECIMAL, FLOAT, and DOUBLE. If the precision of the destination field type is lower than the precision of the source field type, the value with a higher precision may be truncated. This may result in data inconsistency between the source and destination fields.

* If you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization component. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization or reverse incremental migration.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* If you configure matching rules to select tables created by using the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement as migration objects, we recommend that you configure the rules, such as `a.*_2023_backup`, in advance to avoid interruption of the migration project.

* In a multi-table aggregation scenario:

  * We recommend that you map objects in the source and destination databases by importing objects and configuring matching rules.

  * We recommend that you manually create schemas in the destination database. If you use OMS Community Edition to create schemas, skip failed objects in the schema migration step.

1. Create a migration project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | The name of the migration project. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Tag | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a TiDB data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an Oracle data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create a TiDB data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/400.create-a-tidb-data-source.md).<br>  **Notice**<br>If the TiDB data source is not bound to a valid Kafka data source or a topic, incremental synchronization is not supported.  |
   | Destination | If you have created a data source for the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an Oracle data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |

3. Click **Next**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   Note that this project supports only tables with a primary key or a non-null unique index and other tables are automatically filtered out.

5. On the **Select Migration Type** page, specify the related parameters.

   Options available for **Migration Type** include **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Description |
   |------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | The definitions of data objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views, are migrated from the source database to the destination database. Temporary tables are automatically filtered out.  |
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics of the TiDB database before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | **Incremental Synchronization** supports the following DML statements for data synchronization: `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`. You can select statements based on your business needs. For more information, see [DML filtering](1600.migration-function-introduction/100.migration-dml.md). If you create a TiDB data source without binding it to a Kafka data source, you cannot select **Incremental Synchronization**.  |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of the TiDB database and the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database before full verification.    <li> If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but did not select all DML statements in the **DML Synchronization** section, OMS Community Edition does not support full verification. </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li> Multi-table aggregation and synchronization is enabled.    <li>Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.   </ul> |

6. (Optional) Click **Next**. If you have selected **Reverse Incremental Migration** but the ConfigUrl, username, or password is not configured for the data source of the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules** to specify the migration objects.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>The names of tables to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the tables, must not contain Chinese characters. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project. </p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      When you migrate data from a TiDB database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, OMS allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, and remove a single or all migration objects.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | OMS Community Edition allows you to rename the migration objects. For more information, see [Rename a database table](1600.migration-function-introduction/500.db-table-rename.md).  |
      | Remove/Remove All | During data mapping, OMS Community Edition allows you to remove one or more selected objects to be migrated to the destination.  <ul><li>To remove a single migration object:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**.   <li> To remove all migration objects:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**. </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](1600.migration-function-introduction/300.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

8. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have set the migration type to **Full Migration**, this parameter is not displayed.    <li> If you have selected a migration type other than **Full Migration**, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp.<br>  **Notice**<br>You can select the current time or a point in time earlier than the current time. This parameter is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp.   </ul> |
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Import component to customize the concurrency.  <br>**Notice**:<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Verification component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Processing Strategy When Destination Table Has Records | The processing strategy adopted when a destination table contains records. This parameter is displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page. Valid values: **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, the data in the source and destination databases may be inconsistent. </li><li>If you select **Stop Migration**, the project is set to the Failed state when the system detects records in the destination table. To continue data migration, manually resume the project. </li> |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | Specifies whether to create indexes after the full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time required for full migration. The considerations for post-indexing are described below the table. <br>**Notice**:<ul><li>To enable this feature, select both **Schema Migration** and **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  </li> <li>Only non-unique key indexes can be created after the migration is completed. </li><li>OceanBase Database V1.x does not support the post-indexing feature. </li></ul> |

   If you enable post-indexing, we recommend that you adjust the parameters based on the hardware conditions of the destination OceanBase database and the business traffic.

   * If you use OceanBase Database V4.x, use the CLI tool to adjust the following parameters for the business tenant:

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // The file memory buffer limit.
      alter system set _temporary_file_io_area_size = '10' tenant = 'xxx'; 
      // Disable throttling on OceanBase Database V4.x.
      alter system set sys_bkgd_net_percentage = 100;  
      ```

   * If you use OceanBase Database V2.x or V3.x, use the CLI tool to adjust the following parameters for the sys tenant:

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // data_copy_concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent data migration and replication tasks allowed in the system. 
      alter system set data_copy_concurrency = 200; 
      ```

9. Click **Precheck** to start a pre-check on the data migration project.

   During the pre-check, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the pre-check:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the pre-check again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the **Actions** column of a failed pre-check item. In the dialog box that appears, you can view the prompt for the consequences of the operation and click **OK**.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

      OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects when the data migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.
