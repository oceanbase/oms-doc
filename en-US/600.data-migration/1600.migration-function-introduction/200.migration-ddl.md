# DDL synchronization

This topic describes the scenarios, limitations, and procedure of DDL synchronization when you create a data migration project.

## Scenarios

When you create a data migration project, you can specify whether to synchronize DDL operations. DDL operations such as Create Table, Alter Table, Drop Table, and Truncate Table will be synchronized to the destination database only after DDL synchronization is enabled. The DDL synchronization feature applies to long-term data migration and synchronization projects to significantly lower the O&M costs.

## Limitations

* Not all DDL operations are supported. For more information about supported DDL operations, see [Supported DDL operations for synchronization and limitations](../1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/100.mysql-to-obmysql/100.mysql-to-obmysql-overview.md).

* If the table to be synchronized involves other types of DDL operations, the data migration project may fail and cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

* Do not perform DDL operations for database or schema changes during schema migration and full data migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.

## Procedure

1. Create a data migration project and go to the **Select Migration Type** step as prompted.

   For more information, see the topic about creating a data migration project between the corresponding data sources in the [Data migration](../100.data-migration-overview.md) chapter.

2. On the **Select Migration Type** page, select **Incremental Synchronization** and then **DDL Synchronization**.

3. Complete subsequent project settings as prompted.
