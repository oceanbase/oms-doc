# Rename a database table

This topic describes how to use the migration object renaming feature provided by the data transmission component. {#d52153c18de2r}

## Scenarios

By default, migration objects, such as databases and tables, have the same names in the source and destination. You can rename migration objects in the destination to map the database and table names between the source and the destination. The renaming feature applies to multi-table aggregation scenarios and scenarios where the object names in the test and production environments are inconsistent.

>**Note**
>
>The multi-table aggregation feature is used to synchronize database and table sharding data such as DRDS and OneProxy to the same table in the destination.

## Limits

* Data transmission only allows you to rename objects in the step of selecting migration objects when you configure a data migration project.

* Do not rename objects after the data migration project is started. Otherwise, the data migration project may fail.

## Procedure

1. Create a data migration project and configure it to the **Select Migration Objects** step.

   For more information, see the topic about creating a data migration project between the corresponding data sources in the [Data migration](../100.data-migration-overview.md) chapter.

2. After you select migration objects, move the pointer over the target table object in the **Destination Object** list on the right side of the **Specify Migration Scope** section.

3. Click **Rename**.
