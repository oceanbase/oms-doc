# Migrate data within OceanBase Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data between tenants of the same type in OceanBase Database.

## Background

You can create a data migration project in the OMS Community Edition console to migrate the existing business data and incremental data from one tenant to another tenant of the same mode in OceanBase Database through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a corresponding schema in the destination OceanBase database. OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate tables and columns. Therefore, you must create a corresponding schema in the destination database before migration.

* You have created dedicated database users for data migration in the source and destination OceanBase databases and granted the corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

* If you want to migrate data from a table without a primary key, create a user and grant privileges to the user as needed before migration. For more information, see [Create the __oceanbase_inner_drc_user user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limits

* If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

* You can migrate multiple schemas in a data migration project. The migration granularity ranges from a table to a tenant.

* OMS Community Edition allow you to migrate both tables with primary keys and tables without primary keys between OceanBase Community Edition.

* In long-term synchronization between databases, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database.

* If the character set used by the source database is UTF-8, we recommend that you use UTF-8 or a greater character set for the destination database.

* In a one-way data migration project in OceanBase Database, if the source database contains a multi-partition table that has a globally unique index, data may be lost during migration if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

* If the length of a field in the destination database is shorter than that in the source database, the data of this field will be truncated in the destination database, causing data inconsistency between the source and destination databases.

* If you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* If forward switchover is not started in a data migration project, delete the unique indexes and pseudocolumns from the source database. If you do not delete the unique indexes and pseudocolumns, data cannot be written, and pseudocolumns will be generated again when data is imported to the downstream system, causing conflicts with the pseudocolumns in the source database.

## Create a data migration project

1. Create a data migration project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | We recommend that you set it to a combination of Chinese characters, digits, and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Label | Click the field and select the target tag from the drop-down list. You can click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a physical OceanBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Destination | If you have created a physical OceanBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. <br>**Notice:** The destination database cannot be OceanBase Community Edition V4.0.0-CE. |
   | Scenarios | Two scenarios are available: **Data Migration** and **Active-Active Disaster Recovery**. Select **Data Migration**. If you need to select the Active-Active Disaster Recovery scenario, see [Create an active-active disaster recovery project in OceanBase Database](../600.data-migration/1200.create-an-active-active-disaster-recovery-project-in-oceanbase-database.md).  |

3. Click **Next**.

4. On the **Select Migration Type** page, specify related parameters.

   Options are available for **Migration Type** include **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Limits |
   |------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of the source OceanBase database before the data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Options for **Incremental Synchronization** are **DML Synchronization** and **DDL Synchronization**. The DML operations for synchronization are `Insert`, `Delete`, and `Update`. You can select the operations as needed. For more information about supported DDL operations, see [Supported DDL operations for incremental migration and limits](1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/300.obmysql-to-obmysql.md). **Incremental Synchronization** has the following limits: <ul><li> If you do not select **DDL Synchronization**, ensure that the source database involves no modifications and that the incremental DML data has been synchronized to the destination before DDL modifications. Then, perform related DDL operations in the source and destination databases respectively.   <li> If you do not select **DDL Synchronization**, for DDL operations on tables in the migration link, perform these operations in the destination database first. Otherwise, data migration may fail.    <li> If you have selected **DDL Synchronization**, when you perform a DDL operation for incremental migration that is not supported by OMS Community Edition in the source database, data migration may fail. </ul> |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of both the source and destination OceanBase databases before full verification.    <li>If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but did not select all DML statements in **DML Synchronization**, OMS Community Edition does not support full data verification in this scenario.</ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | If a table to migrate has no primary key or unique index and a large amount of data in the table is changed, the reverse incremental migration will take a long time. In this case, you can add unique indexes in the source database. <br>You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li> The **Active-Active Disaster Recovery** scenario is selected.    <li> Multi-table aggregation and synchronization are enabled.    <li> Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.     </ul> |

5. (Optional) Click **Next**.

   * Specify the related information for the source OceanBase database.

      * For incremental synchronization, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password.

      * For schema migration, specify the username and password.

      * For the migration of a table without a unique key, specify the password of `_OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER`.

   * For reverse incremental migration, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password of the source database.

   If you select **Schema Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, or **Reverse Incremental Migration** but no related parameters are configured for the data source of the source or destination database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

6. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select one of the following two modes to migrate objects: **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules**. If you select **DDL Synchronization**, only the **Match Rules** option is available.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      > **Notice**
      >
      > * The name of a table to be migrated and the names of columns in the table must not contain Chinese characters.
      >
      > * If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project.

      When you migrate data between OceanBase databases, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single object or all objects to be migrated.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object.   <li> Click **Rename**.    <li> Enter a new name and click **OK**.   </ol> |
      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to set `WHERE` conditions to filter data by row and view column information. <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object.    <li> Click **Settings**.    <li> In the **Settings** dialog box, specify a standard SQL `WHERE` clause to filter data by row. The setting takes effect for **full migration** and **incremental synchronization**.<br>  **Notice** <ul><li> Add an escape character (\`) for column names. Example: \`col\`.  <li>Only the data meeting the `WHERE` condition is synchronized to the destination data source, thereby filtering data by row.      <li>If row-based filtering with the `WHERE` clause is enabled, right-trim is forcibly performed on data of the CHAR or VARCHAR type, which may cause an inaccurate comparison of the VARCHAR data. Proceed with caution.   </ul>    <li> Click **OK**.  <br>You can also view column information of the migration object in the **View Columns** section.  </ol> |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove one or more objects from the destination database during data mapping. <ul><li>Remove a single migration object <br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**. The migration object is removed.   <li> Remove all migration objects <br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all migration objects. </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](../600.data-migration/2100.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

7. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The amount of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the checker component to customize the concurrency.  <br>**Notice**<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the checker component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Whether to Allow Destination Table to Be Not Empty During Full Migration | If destination tables are allowed to be not empty during full migration, full verification is performed in `IN` mode.   <br>**Notice**<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | You can specify whether to allow post-indexing after full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time of full migration. <br>**Notice**<ul><li>To enable this feature, select both **Schema Migration** and **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.   <li>Only non-unique key indexes can be created after the migration is completed. </ul> |

8. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck****, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned:

   * You can troubleshoot the error and run the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the Actions column of the precheck item that returns the error. Then, a dialog box appears, indicating the impact that may be caused if you choose to skip this check item. If you want to continue, click **OK** in the dialog box.

9. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify migration objects when a data migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md).
