# Migrate data from HBase to OBKV

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from HBase to OBKV.

## Background information

In the console of OMS Community Edition, you can create a project to migrate data from HBase to OBKV. OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate existing and incremental business data from the source database to OBKV through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

## Prerequisites

* You have created the corresponding schema in the destination OBKV. OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate tables and columns. Therefore, you must create the corresponding schema in the destination database before migration.

* You have created a Flink cluster of version 1.14.0 if you want to perform migration in Flink mode.

## Limitations

* Limitations on the source database:

   Do not perform DDL operations for database or schema changes during schema migration or full data migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.

* At present, HBase 1.2.0-cdh5.15.2 is supported.

* In a project to migrate data from HBase to OBKV, tag data cannot be migrated, and full verification and reverse incremental migration are not supported.

* During incremental synchronization, you cannot import incremental data from the source HBase in bulk loading mode.

## Considerations

* The progress and estimated time displayed on the pages of the OMS Community Edition console are for reference only because table statistics of HBase cannot be obtained. You can calculate the amount of time required based on the real-time requests per second (RPS) value and the number of records in the table.

* Incremental data in HBase is replicated by using a peer. Therefore, a peer will be created in the source HBase database. If the process of the Incr-Sync component of OMS Community Edition is stopped for a long time, incremental data in the source HBase database may fail to be sent to the incremental synchronization task of OMS Community Edition. This will lead to a situation of the disk space being used up.

* The peer cannot specify the start timestamp for incremental synchronization of HBase. The start timestamp for incremental synchronization is related only to the creation time of the peer. Therefore, if the peer is deleted, you must create a data migration project again and initialize a full migration task.

* When migration is performed in Flink mode, if you want to interrupt the migration, you must stop the full migration and incremental synchronization tasks in OMS Community Edition and stop the jobs in Flink.

   You can search for a job in Flink by the ID of the corresponding data migration project in OMS Community Edition.

   * The ID of a full migration job is in the OMS_BATCH_{Project ID in OMS Community Edition} format.

   * The ID of an incremental synchronization job is in the OMS_STREAM_{Project ID in OMS Community Edition} format.

      You can also obtain the Flink job IDs from the `/home/ds/run/{Component ID}/conf/flink_jobid` file in the container of OMS Community Edition.

* No statistics are collected for an incremental synchronization task that synchronizes data from HBase to OBKV.

## Data type mappings

The column family in HBase is mapped to the default schema in OBKV as shown in the following table creation statement:

```sql
create table if not exists {TABLE_NAME} -- Mapped to HBase {namespace}.{table_name}${column_family}
(
    `K` varbinary(1024) not null, -- Mapped to a rowkey in HBase
    `Q` varbinary(256) not null,  -- Mapped to a column name in the column family of HBase
    `T` bigint not null,          -- Mapped to a version or timestamp in HBase
    `V` varbinary(1048576),       -- Mapped to a value in HBase
    primary key(`K`, `Q`, `T`))
partition by key(`K`) partitions 64
```

You can use `struct.obkv.createtable` to modify the default table creation statement in OBKV for schema migration.

| Parameter | Description | Table creation statement |
|-----------|---------|-----------------------|
| struct.obkv.createtable | You can change the value of this parameter on the **System Parameters** page to set the default table creation statement in OBKV for schema migration for all projects.  | `create table if not exists {TABLE_NAME} (`K`varbinary(1024) not null,`Q`varbinary(256) not null,`T`bigint not null,`V`varbinary(1048576),primary key(`K`,`Q`,`T`)) partition by key(`K`) partitions 64` |
| structObkvCreatetable | You can choose **Migration Options** > **Incremental Synchronization**, click **Configurations**, and then modify the `sink.json` configuration to set the default table creation statement in OBKV for schema migration for the current project.  | `create table if not exists {TABLE_NAME} (`K`varbinary(1024) not null,`Q`varbinary(256) not null,`T`bigint not null,`V`varbinary(1048576),primary key(`K`,`Q`,`T`)) partition by key(`K`) partitions 64` |

## Procedure

1. Create a data migration project.

   1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | The name of the data migration project. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Tag | The tag to add to the project. Click the field and select the target tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | The source of the data migration project. If you have created an HBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an HBase data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about the parameters, see [Create an HBase data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/1000.create-a-hbase-data-source.md).  |
   | Destination | The destination of the data migration project. If you have created a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |

3. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Type** page, configure the parameters.

   The following options are available for **Migration Type**: **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, and **Incremental Synchronization**.

   | Migration type | Description |
   |------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema migration | After a schema migration task is started, OMS Community Edition migrates the definitions of database objects (including tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views) from the source database to the destination database and automatically filters out temporary tables.  |
   | Full migration | After a full migration task is started, OMS Community Edition migrates existing data of tables in the source database to corresponding tables in the destination database.  |
   | Incremental synchronization | After an incremental synchronization task is started, OMS Community Edition synchronizes changed data (data that is added, modified, or deleted) from the source database to corresponding tables in the destination database.  |

4. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules** to specify the migration objects.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. OBKV supports only tables with a single column family. Therefore, a table with multiple column families in HBase corresponds to multiple tables in OBKV.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>The names of tables to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the tables, must not contain Chinese characters. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project. </p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </main>


      OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects from text files, rename objects, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single migration object or all migration objects.

      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to use the `WHERE` clause to filter data by row. For more information, see [Use SQL conditions to filter data](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/600.migration-row-filters.md). <br>You can also view column information of the migration objects in the **View Column** section.  |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single object or all objects to be migrated to the destination database during data mapping.  <ul><li>To remove a single migration object, perform the following steps:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**.   <li> To remove all migration objects, perform the following steps:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.   </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/300.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

5. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   * Full migration

      The following parameters are displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |----|----------------------------------|
      | Concurrency Speed | Valid options are **Stable**, **Normal**, **Fast**, and **Custom**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance. If you select **Custom**, you can specify **Read Concurrency**, **Write Concurrency**, and **JVM Memory** based on the actual situation.  |
      | Processing Strategy When Records Exist in Target Object | Valid options are **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, the data in the source and destination databases may be inconsistent. </li><li>If you select **Stop Migration**, the project is set to the Failed state when the system detects records in the destination table. To continue data migration, manually resume the project. </li> </ul> |
      | Computing Platform | The default value is `Local`, which indicates the local running mode. You can also choose to run on the created Flink computing platform. To create a computing platform, click **Manage Computing Platform** in the drop-down list. For more information, see [Manage computing platforms](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/210.manage-computing-platform.md).  |

      In full migration, full data is obtained by reading hfiles by default. You can change the value of `queryType` in `source`. Valid values of `queryType` are `hfile` and `scan`. By default, the table flush operation is performed. If you do not require the table flush operation, set the value of `flushTable` to `false` in `source`. If you want to view or modify full migration configurations, click **Configurations** in the upper-right corner of the **Full Migration** section. For more information, see [Component parameters](../1100.o-m-guide/500.component-parameters/100.coordinator.md).

   * Incremental synchronization

      The following parameters are displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |----|----------------------------------|
      | Concurrency Speed | Valid options are **Stable**, **Normal**, **Fast**, and **Custom**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance. If you select **Custom**, you can specify **Read Concurrency**, **Write Concurrency**, and **JVM Memory** based on the actual situation.  |
      | Peer ID | Retain the default value.  |
      | rootDir | Retain the default value.  |
      | zkHost | The ZooKeeper configurations used by the Incr-Sync component to simulate HBase. This parameter is required.  |
      | zkPath | Retain the default value.  |
      | Computing Platform | The default value is `Local`, which indicates the local running mode. You can also choose to run on the created Flink computing platform. To create a computing platform, click **Manage Computing Platform** in the drop-down list. For more information, see [Manage computing platforms](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/210.manage-computing-platform.md).  |

      In incremental synchronization, a simulated region is started by default. You can change the value of `regions` in `source`. If a large amount of incremental data is to be synchronized, you can configure multiple `regions` to accelerate incremental synchronization. If you want to view or modify incremental synchronization configurations, click **Configurations** in the upper-right corner of the **Incremental Synchronization** section. For more information, see [Component parameters](../1100.o-m-guide/500.component-parameters/100.coordinator.md).

6. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition verifies whether the read and write privileges of the database user and whether the network connection to the database meet the requirements. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the Actions column of the failed precheck item. A dialog box appears, prompting you the impact. If you want to skip this operation, click **OK**.

7. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects of an ongoing data migration project. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.
