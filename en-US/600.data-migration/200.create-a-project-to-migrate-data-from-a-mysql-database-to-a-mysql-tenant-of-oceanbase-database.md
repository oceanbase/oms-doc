# Migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition.

## Background

You can create a data migration project in the OMS Community Edition console to migrate the existing business data and incremental data from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

The MySQL database supports the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode.

| Type | Supported Operation |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | Schema migration, full migration, and full verification |
| Primary/standby databases | Primary database: incremental synchronization and reverse incremental migration Standby database: schema migration, full migration, and full verification |

## Prerequisites

* You have enabled binlogs for the self-managed MySQL database. For more information, see [Enable binlogs for the MySQL database](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/500.enable-binlogs-for-the-mysql-database.md).

* You have created dedicated database users in the source MySQL database and the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database for data migration and granted the corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

   | **Database** | **Schema migration** | **Full migration** | **Incremental synchronization** |
   |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Self-managed MySQL database | SELECT privilege <br>For MySQL 8.0, the SHOW VIEW privilege is also required. | SELECT privilege | REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, SHOW VIEW, and SELECT privileges |
   | MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database | CREATE, CREATE VIEW, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges | Read/Write privileges | Read/Write privileges |

## Limitations

* **Operation limitations on the source database**

   **Do not perform DDL operations on databases or tables during schema migration and full migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.**

* OMS Community Edition supports the following MySQL database versions: 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. OMS Community Edition supports only the MySQL InnoDB storage engine, and is unavailable for other engines.

* The precheck fails if the primary key is data of the FLOAT or DOUBLE type. We recommend that you do not use data of these types as the primary key.

* If the destination data source is a database, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database. If triggers exist in the destination database, the data migration may fail.

* OMS Community Edition does not support an index field greater than 767 bytes (or 191 characters) in length for MySQL.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition supports the synchronization of only objects whose database name and table name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / & \n

* If the `lower_case_table_names` settings of the source and destination are different, the project cannot be created. In addition, OMS Community Edition does not support the case sensitivity of MySQL databases and OceanBase databases. That is, even when `lower_case_table_names=0` is set in the source and destination databases, projects cannot be created.

   By default, `lower_case_table_names` is set to `1` in the destination database, and the destination database objects are created with lowercase names.

* OMS Community Edition does not support CASCADE foreign key migration for source MySQL databases.

* The clock of the source database is synchronized with that of the destination database.

* During reverse incremental migration from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, if the MySQL tenant is of a version earlier than V3.2.x and contains a multi-partition table that has a globally unique index, data may be lost during migration if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

## Considerations

* The host of the MySQL database must have sufficient outbound bandwidth. Insufficient outbound bandwidth on the host will slow down log parsing and data migration, which may increase the latency of data synchronization.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization or reverse incremental migration.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* If collations of the source and destination databases are different, a table whose primary key is data of the VARCHAR type fails the data consistency verification.

* If incremental parsing is required for the MySQL database, you must specify the ID of the MySQL server.

* When DDL synchronization is disabled, if you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization component. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* Check whether the migration precision of OMS Community Edition is as expected for columns of data types such as DECIMAL, FLOAT, and DOUBLE. If the precision of the destination field type is lower than the precision of the source field type, the value with a higher precision may be truncated. This may result in data inconsistency between the source and destination fields.

* If you configure matching rules to select tables created by using the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement as migration objects, we recommend that you configure the rules, such as `a.*_2023_backup`, in advance to avoid interruption of the migration project.

* In a multi-table aggregation scenario:

  * We recommend that you map objects in the source and destination databases by importing objects and configuring matching rules.

  * We recommend that you manually create schemas in the destination database. If you use OMS Community Edition to create schemas, skip failed objects in the schema migration step.

## Procedure

1. Create a data migration project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | The name of the migration project. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. The name cannot contain spaces or exceed 64 characters in length. <br>**Notice**<br>The project name must be a unique identifier in the OMS Community Edition system.  |
   | Tag | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a MySQL data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an Oracle data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about parameters, see [Create a MySQL data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/200.create-a-mysql-data-source.md). <br>**Note:**<ul><li>If you select **Allow OMS to automatically write heartbeat data into this instance during incremental synchronization. This resolves the problem of high latency when no business data is written in the source database** when you add a MySQL data source, OMS Community Edition will create and update the `drc.heartbeat` table in the corresponding MySQL database. In that case, the MySQL database user must have the privileges to create and write the table. For more information, see [Create and update a heartbeat table](1600.migration-function-introduction/700.create-heartbeat.md). <li> You can select a MySQL data source in primary database only mode or primary/standby databases mode. This topic describes how to create a data migration project with a MySQL data source in primary/standby databases mode. </ul> |
   | Destination | If you have created a data source for the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created an Oracle data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Scenario Type | Valid values: **Tables with Unique Key** and **All Tables**.<ul><li>If a table has primary key constraints or unique constraints, and fields in the table are unique, this table is a table with a unique key. <li>If you select All Tables, tables that have unique and non-unique keys, except for temporary tables, are included. </ul> |

3. Click **Next**.

   If you have selected **Tables with Unique Key** for Scenario, click **OK** in the dialog box that appears.

4. On the **Select Migration Type** page, specify the related parameters.

   Options available for **Migration Type** include **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Limitations |
   |------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | In a project that migrates schemas from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, the database that does not exist in the destination can be automatically created.  |
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics of the MySQL database before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Options for **Incremental Synchronization** are [DML Synchronization](1600.migration-function-introduction/100.migration-dml.md) and [DDL Synchronization](1600.migration-function-introduction/200.migration-ddl.md). You can select the operations as needed. For more information about DDL synchronization, see [Synchronize DDL operations from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database](1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/100.mysql-to-obmysql/100.mysql-to-obmysql-overview.md). **Incremental Synchronization** has the following limitations:<ul><li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization**, you need to enable binlogs for the source MySQL database, and set `binlog_row_image` to `full` and `binlog_format` to `row`.    <li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization**, the binlogs of the MySQL database must be retained for no less than 24 hours. Otherwise, the migration project may be interrupted because of the absence of binlogs, which cannot be recovered.    <li> If you select **DDL Synchronization**, when you perform a DDL operation that is not supported by OMS Community Edition in the source database, data migration may fail. <li>If the DDL operation creates a new column, we recommend that you set the attribute of the column to Null. Otherwise, data migration may be interrupted. </ul> |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of the MySQL database and the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database before full verification.    <li>If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but did not select all DML statements in the **DML Synchronization** section, OMS Community Edition does not support full verification. <li>OMS Community Edition supports full data verification of only tables with a unique key. </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases:<ul><li>Multi-table aggregation and synchronization is enabled.   <li>Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.  |

5. (Optional) Click **Next**. If you have selected **Reverse Incremental Migration** but the ConfigUrl, username, or password is not configured for the data source of the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

6. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules** to specify the migration objects.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>The names of tables to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the tables, must not contain Chinese characters. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Do not select a table named in the format of *_ghc. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>If you select <b>Specify Objects</b> to specify the migration objects, the DDL operations take effect only for the selected objects, and you cannot create new tables. </p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      When you migrate data from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove one or all objects to be migrated.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | OMS Community Edition allows you to rename the migration objects. For more information, see [Rename a database table](1600.migration-function-introduction/500.db-table-rename.md).  |
      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows. For more information, see [Use SQL conditions to filter data](1600.migration-function-introduction/600.migration-row-filters.md) <br>You can also view column information of the migration object in the **View Column** section.  |
      | Remove/Remove All | During data mapping, OMS Community Edition allows you to remove one or more selected objects to be migrated to the destination.  <ul><li>To remove a single migration object:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**.   <li> To remove all migration objects:<br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.   </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](1600.migration-function-introduction/300.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>Set <strong>Object Exclusion Rule</strong> to <code>{database_name}.*_ghc</code>. </p>
      </main>

7. Click **Next**.

   If you select **All Tables** for Scenario, click **Next** in the dialog box that appears.

8. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have set the migration type to **Full Migration**, this parameter is not displayed.    <li> If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but not **Full Migration**, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp.<br>  **Notice**<br>You can select the current time or a point in time earlier than the current time. This parameter is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp.   </ul> |
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Import component to customize the concurrency.  <br>**Notice**:<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Verification component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Processing Strategy When Destination Table Has Records | The processing strategy adopted when a destination table contains records. This parameter is displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page. Valid values: **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, the data in the source and destination databases may be inconsistent. </li><li>If you select **Stop Migration**, the project is set to the Failed state when the system detects records in the destination table. To continue data migration, manually resume the project. </li> |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | Specifies whether to create indexes after the full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time required for full migration. The considerations for post-indexing are described below the table. <br>**Notice**:<ul><li>To enable this feature, select both **Schema Migration** and **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  </li> <li>Only non-unique key indexes can be created after the migration is completed. </li><li>OceanBase Database V1.x does not support the post-indexing feature. </li></ul> |

   If you enable post-indexing, we recommend that you adjust the parameters based on the hardware conditions of the destination OceanBase database and the business traffic.

   * If you use OceanBase Database V4.x, use the CLI tool to adjust the following parameters for the business tenant:

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // The file memory buffer limit.
      alter system set _temporary_file_io_area_size = '10' tenant = 'xxx'; 
      // Disable throttling on OceanBase Database V4.x.
      alter system set sys_bkgd_net_percentage = 100;  
      ```

   * If you use OceanBase Database V2.x or V3.x, use the CLI tool to adjust the following parameters for the sys tenant:

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node. 
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel. 
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64; 
      // data_copy_concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent data migration and replication tasks allowed in the system. 
      alter system set data_copy_concurrency = 200; 
      ```

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the **Actions** column of a failed precheck item. In the dialog box that appears, you can view the prompt for the consequences of the operation and click **OK**.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

      OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects when the data migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.
