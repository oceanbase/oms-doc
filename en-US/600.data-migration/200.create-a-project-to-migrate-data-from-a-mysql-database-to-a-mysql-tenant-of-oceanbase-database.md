# Migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition

This topic describes how to migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Background information

You can create a data migration project in the OMS Community Edition console to migrate the existing business data and incremental data from a self-managed MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

MySQL databases support the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode.

| Mode | Supported operation |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | Schema migration, full migration, and full verification |
| Primary/standby databases | Primary database: incremental synchronization and reverse incremental migration Standby database: schema migration, full migration, and full verification |

## Prerequisites

* You have enabled binlogs for the self-managed MySQL database. For more information, see [Enable binlogs for the MySQL database](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/500.enable-binlogs-for-the-mysql-database.md).

* You have created dedicated database users for data migration in the self-managed source MySQL database and the destination OceanBase database of Community Edition, and granted the corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limitations

* Operation limitations on the source database

   Do not perform DDL operations for database or schema changes during schema migration and full data migration. Otherwise, the data migration project may be interrupted.

* OMS Community Edition supports the following MySQL database versions: 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. In addition, OMS Community Edition supports only the MySQL InnoDB storage engine and is unavailable for other engines.

* The precheck fails if the primary key is data of the FLOAT or DOUBLE type. We recommend that you do not use data of these types as the primary key.

* If the destination is a database, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database. If triggers exist in the destination database, the data migration may fail.

* OMS Community Edition does not support an index field greater than 767 bytes (or 191 characters) in length in MySQL databases.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition supports the migration of only objects whose database name, table name, and column name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are line breaks and . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / &.

* If the `lower_case_table_names` settings of the source database and destination database are different, the project cannot be created. When you migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database, object names are not case-sensitive. OMS Community Edition does not allow you to create a project when `lower_case_table_names` is set to 0 for the source database and destination database.

   The default configuration `lower_case_table_names = 1` of the destination database is used. Database objects are created with lowercase names in the destination database.

* OMS Community Edition does not support CASCADE foreign key migration for source MySQL databases.

* The clock of the source database is synchronized with that of the destination database.

* During reverse incremental migration from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition earlier than V3.2.x, data loss may occur if you update the value of the partitioning key of a multi-partition table with a globally unique index.

## Considerations

* The host of the MySQL database must have sufficient outbound bandwidth. Insufficient outbound bandwidth on the host will slow down log parsing and data migration, which may increase the latency of data synchronization.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization or reverse incremental migration.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* If collations of the source and destination databases are different, a table whose primary key is data of the VARCHAR type fails the data consistency verification.

* If incremental parsing is required for the source MySQL database, you must specify the ID of the MySQL server by using `server_id`.

* When DDL synchronization is disabled, if you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization component. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* Check whether the migration precision of OMS Community Edition for columns of data types such as DECIMAL, FLOAT, and DOUBLE is as expected. If the precision of the destination field type is lower than the precision of the source field type, the value with a higher precision may be truncated. This may result in data inconsistency between the source and destination fields.

* If you configure matching rules to select tables created by using the CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (CTAS) statement as migration objects, we recommend that you configure the rules, such as `a.*_2023_backup`, in advance to avoid interruption of the migration project.

* In a multi-table aggregation scenario:

  * We recommend that you map objects in the source and destination by importing objects and configuring matching rules.

  * We recommend that you manually create schemas in the destination. If you create a schema by using OMS Community Edition, skip the failed objects in the schema migration step.

* OMS Community Edition does not require the quantities of fields in the source database and destination database to be the same. During full migration or incremental synchronization, if an error table field in the source database does not exist in the destination database, you can set the `ignoreRedunantColumnsReplicate` parameter of the **Full-Import** or **Incr-Sync** component to `true` and then resume the data migration project.

   | Destination | If you have created a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create one in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Scenario Type | Valid values: **Tables with Unique Key** and **All Tables**.<ul><li>If a table has primary key constraints or unique constraints, and fields in the table are unique, this table is a table with a unique key. <li>If you select All Tables, tables that have unique and non-unique keys, except for temporary tables, are included. </ul> |

3. Click **Next**.

   If you select **Tables with Unique Key** for Scenario Type, click **OK** in the dialog box that appears.

4. On the **Select Migration Type** page, configure the related parameters.

   Options for **Migration Type** are **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Description |
   |------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | In a project that migrates schemas from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition, the database that does not exist in the destination can be automatically created.  |
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics on the MySQL database before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Options for **Incremental Synchronization** are [DML Synchronization](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/100.migration-dml.md) and [DDL Synchronization](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/200.migration-ddl.md). You can select the operations as needed. For more information about DDL synchronization, see [Supported DDL operations and limits for incremental migration from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition](../600.data-migration/1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/100.mysql-to-obmysql/100.mysql-to-obmysql-overview.md). **Incremental Synchronization** has the following limitations:<ul><li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization**, you need to enable binlogs for the source MySQL database, and set `binlog_row_image` to `full` and `binlog_format` to `row`.    <li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization**, the binlogs of the MySQL database must be retained for no less than 24 hours. Otherwise, the migration project may be interrupted because of the absence of binlogs, which cannot be recovered.    <li> If you select **DDL Synchronization**, when you perform a DDL operation that is not supported by OMS Community Edition in the source database, data migration may fail. <li>If the DDL operation creates a new column, we recommend that you set the attribute of the column to Null. Otherwise, data migration may be interrupted. </ul> |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect statistics on both the MySQL database and OceanBase Database Community Edition before full verification. For more information about how to collect statistics on OceanBase Database Community Edition, see [Manually collect statistics](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community/10000000000902235).    <li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but do not select all DML statements in the **DML Synchronization** section, you cannot select `Full Verification` in OMS Community Edition. <li>OMS Community Edition supports full data verification only for tables with a unique key. </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li>Multi-table aggregation and synchronization is enabled.   <li>Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.  |

5. (Optional) Click **Next**. If you have selected **Reverse Incremental Migration** but the ConfigUrl, username, or password is not configured for the destination data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

6. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules** to specify the migration objects.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>

      <h4>Notice</h4>

      <ul>

      <li>
         <p>The names of tables to be migrated, as well as the names of columns in the tables, must not contain Chinese characters. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
         <p>Do not select a table named in the format of *_ghc. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
         <p>If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project. </p>

      </li>

      <li>
         <p>After you select migration objects by using the <b>Specify Objects</b> option, the DDL operations take effect only for the selected objects, and table creation is not supported.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      </main>

      OMS Community Edition also allows you to import objects from text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove a single object or all objects to be migrated.

      <h4>Notice</h4>

      <p>Set <strong>Object Exclusion Rule</strong> to <code>{database_name}.*_ghc</code>. </p>

      </main>

7. Click **Next**.

   If you select **All Tables** for Scenario Type, click **Next** in the dialog box that appears.

8. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you have set the migration type to **Full Migration**, this parameter is not displayed.    <li> If you select **Incremental Synchronization** but not **Full Migration**, specify a point in time after which the data is to be synchronized. The default value is the current system time. For more information, see [Set an incremental synchronization timestamp](../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/1000.incremental-synchronization-timestamp.md).  |
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The number of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Import component to customize the concurrency.  <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p> To enable this feature, select <b>Full Migration</b> on the <b>Select Migration Type</b> page. </p></main> |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Full-Verification component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The period for which incremental parsed files are retained in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Processing Strategy When Destination Table Has Records | The processing strategy adopted when a destination table contains records. This parameter is displayed only when **Full Migration** is selected on the **Select Migration Type** page. Valid values: **Ignore** and **Stop Migration**.<ul><li>If you select **Ignore**, the data in the source and destination databases may be inconsistent. </li><li>If you select **Stop Migration**, the project is set to the Failed state when the system detects records in the destination table. To continue data migration, manually resume the project. </li> |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | Specifies whether to create indexes after the full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time required for full migration. The considerations for post-indexing are described below the table. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>To enable this feature, select both <b>Schema Migration</b> and <b>Full Migration</b> on the <b>Select Migration Type</b> page. </p> </main> |

   If you enable post-indexing, we recommend that you modify the parameters based on the hardware conditions of the destination OceanBase database and the business traffic.

   * In OceanBase Database V4.x, modify the following sys and business tenant parameters by using a CLI client tool.

      * Modify sys tenant parameters

         ```sql
         // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node.
         // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel.
         set global parallel_servers_target = 64;
         ```

      * Modify business tenant parameters

         ```sql
         // The file memory buffer limit.
         alter system set _temporary_file_io_area_size = '10' tenant = 'xxx';
         // Disable throttling on OceanBase Database V4.x.
         alter system set sys_bkgd_net_percentage = 100;
         ```

   * In OceanBase Database V3.x, modify the following sys tenant parameters by using a CLI client tool.

      ```sql
      // parallel_servers_target specifies the queuing conditions for parallel queries on each OBServer node.
      // To achieve higher performance, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than the number of physical CPU cores. For example, you can set it to 1.5 times the number of physical CPU cores. However, do not set this parameter to a value greater than 64. Otherwise, lock contention may occur in the OceanBase Database kernel.
      set global parallel_servers_target = 64;
      // data_copy_concurrency specifies the maximum number of concurrent data migration and replication tasks allowed in the system.
      alter system set data_copy_concurrency = 200;
      ```

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the **precheck**, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the Actions column of the failed precheck item. A dialog box appears, prompting you the impact. If you want to skip this operation, click **OK**.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the migration objects of a migration project when the project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be processed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](../600.data-migration/1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md) topic.
