# Migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition.

## Background

You can create a data migration project in the OMS Community Edition console to migrate the existing business data and incremental data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition through schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization.

The MySQL database supports the following modes: primary database only, standby database only, and primary/standby databases. The following table describes the data migration operations supported by each mode.

| Type | Supported operations |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary database only | Schema migration, full migration, incremental synchronization, full verification, and reverse incremental migration |
| Standby database only | Schema migration, full migration, and full verification |
| Primary/Standby databases | Primary database: incremental synchronization and reverse incremental migration. Standby database: schema migration, full migration, and full verification |

## Prerequisites

* You have created a corresponding schema in the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database. OMS Community Edition allows you to migrate tables and columns. Therefore, you must create a corresponding schema in the destination database before migration.

* You have enabled binlogs for the self-managed MySQL database. For more information, see [Enable binlogs for the MySQL database](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/500.enable-binlogs-for-the-mysql-database.md).

* You have created dedicated database users in the source MySQL database and the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database for data migration and granted the corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

   | **Database** | **Schema migration** | **Full migration** | **Incremental synchronization** |
   |------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Self-managed MySQL database | SELECT privilege <br>For MySQL 8.0, the SHOW VIEW privilege is also required. | SELECT privilege | REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, SHOW VIEW, and SELECT privileges |
   | MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database | CREATE, CREATE VIEW, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges | Read/Write privileges | Read/Write privileges |

## Limits

* OMS Community Edition supports the following MySQL database versions: 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. OMS Community Edition supports only the MySQL InnoDB storage engine, and is unavailable for other engines.

* The precheck fails if the primary key is data of the FLOAT or DOUBLE type. We recommend that you do not use data of these types as the primary key.

* In long-term synchronization between databases, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database.

* The host of the MySQL database must have sufficient outbound bandwidth. Insufficient outbound bandwidth on the host will slow down log parsing and data migration and may increase the latency of data synchronization.

* If the source database is a MySQL database, the character set must be UTF-8, UTF8MB4, or GBK. If the source database uses UTF-8, we recommend that you use UTF-8 or a greater character set for the destination database.

* The clock of the source database must be synchronized with that of the destination database.

* If the `lower_case_table_names` settings of the source and destination databases are different, the project cannot be created.

* During reverse incremental migration from OceanBase Community Edition to a MySQL database, if the OceanBase Community Edition contains a multi-partition table that has a globally unique index, data may be lost during migration if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

* If collations of the source and destination databases are different, a table whose primary key is data of the VARCHAR type fails the data verification.

* OMS Community Edition does not support CASCADE foreign key migration for source MySQL databases.

* If incremental parsing is required for the MySQL database, you must specify the ID of the MySQL server.

* OMS Community Edition does not support an index field greater than 767 bytes (or 191 characters) in length for MySQL.

* If you change the unique index of the destination, you must restart the incremental synchronization. Otherwise, the data may be inconsistent.

* When the length of a field in the destination database is shorter than that in the source database, the data of this field is automatically truncated by the database, which causes data inconsistency between the source and destination databases.

## Create a data migration project

1. Create a migration project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select the Source and the Destination** page, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | We recommend that you set it to a combination of Chinese characters, digits, and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Tag | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a MySQL data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **New Data Source** in the drop-down list to add one in the dialog box on the right side. For more information, see [Create a MySQL data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/200.create-a-mysql-data-source.md). <br>You can select a MySQL data source in primary database only mode or primary/standby databases mode. This topic describes how to create a data migration project with a MySQL data source in primary/standby databases mode.  |
   | Destination | If you have created a data source for the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **New Data Source** in the drop-down list to add one in the dialog box on the right side. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Scenario | Valid values: **Tables with Unique Key** and **All Tables**.<ul><li>If a table has primary key constraints or unique constraints, and fields in the table are unique, this table is a table with a unique key. <li>If you select **All Tables**, tables that have unique and non-unique keys, except for temporary tables, are included. </ul> |

3. Click **Next**.

   If you have selected **Tables with Unique Key** for **Scenario**, click **OK** in the dialog box that appears.

4. On the **Select Migration Type** page, specify related parameters.

   Options available for **Migration Type** include **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Limits |
   |------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Schema Migration | In a project that migrates schemas from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition, the database that does not exist in the destination can be automatically created.  |
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics of the MySQL database before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | Options available for **Incremental Synchronization** include **DML Synchronization** and **DDL Synchronization**. The DML operations supported include `Insert`, `Delete`, and `Update`. You can select the operations based on your business needs. For more information, see [Supported DDL operations for incremental migration and limits](1700.supported-ddl-operations-for-incremental-migration-and-limits/100.mysql-to-obmysql.md). **Incremental Synchronization** has the following limits:<ul><li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization**, you need to enable binlogs for the source MySQL database, and set `binlog_row_image` to `full` and `binlog_format` to `row`.    <li>If you select **Incremental Synchronization**, the binlogs of the MySQL database must be retained for no less than 24 hours. Otherwise, the migration project may be interrupted because of the absence of binlogs, which cannot be recovered.    <li> If you do not select **DDL Synchronization**, ensure that the source database involves no modifications and that the incremental DML data has been synchronized to the destination before DDL modifications. Then, perform related DDL operations in the source and destination databases respectively.   <li>If you do not select **DDL Synchronization**, for DDL operations on tables in the migration link, perform these operations in the destination database first. Otherwise, data migration may fail.    <li> If you have selected **DDL Synchronization**, when you perform a DDL operation for incremental migration that is not supported by OMS Community Edition in the source database, data migration may fail. </ul> |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of the MySQL database and the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database before full verification.   <li>If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but did not select all DML statements in **DML Synchronization**, OMS Community Edition does not support full data verification in this scenario. <li>OMS Community Edition supports full data verification of only tables with a unique key. </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li>Multi-table aggregation and synchronization is enabled.   <li>Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.  |

5. (Optional) Click **Next**. If you have selected **Reverse Incremental Migration** but the ConfigUrl, username, or password is not configured for the data source of the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

6. Click **Next**. On the **Select Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select one of the following two modes to migrate objects: **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules**. If you have selected **DDL Synchronization**, only the **Match Rules** option is available.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **\>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      > **Notice:**
      >
      > * The name of a table to be migrated and the names of columns in the table must not contain Chinese characters.
      >
      > * Do not select a table named in the format of \*_ghc.
      >
      > * If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project.

      When you migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition, OMS allows you to import objects through text, rename object names, set row filters, view column information, and remove one or all objects to be migrated.

      | Operation | Procedure |
      |---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice:**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases or tables and set row filter conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object.   <li> Click **Rename**.    <li> Enter a new name and click **OK**.   </ol> |
      | Settings | OMS allows you to set `WHERE` conditions to filter data by row and view column information. <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object.    <li> Click **Settings**.    <li> In the **Settings** dialog box, enter a `WHERE` clause of a standard SQL statement to configure row-based filtering. The setting takes effect for full migration and incremental synchronization.<br>  **Notice:** <ul><li> Add an escape character (`\`) for column names, for example, `\`col`\`.  <li>Only the data meeting the `WHERE` clause is synchronized to the destination data source and filtered by row.   <li>If row-based filtering with the `WHERE` clause is enabled, right-trim is forcibly performed on data of the CHAR or VARCHAR type, which may cause an inaccurate comparison of the VARCHAR data. Proceed with caution.   </ul>    <li> Click **OK**.  <br>You can also view column information of the migration object in the **View Columns** section.  </ol> |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single object or all objects to be migrated to the destination database during data mapping.  <ul><li>Remove a single migration object: <br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**. The migration object is removed.   <li> Remove all migration objects: <br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all migration objects.   </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](../600.data-migration/2100.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

      > **Notice:**
      >
      > Set **Object Exclusion Rule** to {database_name}.\*_ghc.``

7. Click **Next**.

   If you select **All Tables** for Scenario, click **Next** in the dialog box that appears.

8. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The quantity of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Checker-Full component to customize the concurrency.  <br>**Notice**:<br> To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the Checker-Full component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the Store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Whether to Allow Destination Table to Be Not Empty During Full Migration | If destination tables are allowed to be not empty during full migration, full verification is performed in `IN` mode.  <br>**Notice:** <br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page. |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | You can specify whether to allow post-indexing after full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time of full migration. <br>**Notice:**<ul><li>To enable this feature, select both **Schema Migration** and **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.   <li>Only non-unique key indexes can be created after the migration is completed. </ul> |

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can click **Skip** in the **Actions** column of the precheck item with the error. A dialog box will be displayed, prompting the impact caused if you skip this error. If you want to continue, click **OK** in the dialog box.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify migration objects when a data migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/200.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](1500.manage-data-migration-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md).
