# oms_host_down 


## Impact on the system 

When an OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition host is down, it becomes unavailable.



## Possible causes 

* The host or Docker container is down for unknown reasons.

  

* The `oms_drc_supervisor` application is interrupted. You can run `supervisorctl` to check whether the application is interrupted.

  

* The network is disconnected.


## Solution 

* If the `oms_drc_supervisor` application is interrupted, log on to the host and run `supervisorctl restart oms_drc_supervisor` to restart the application. If the application still fails, go to the `/home/admin/logs/supervisor` directory to view the error logs.
  

* If this alert is triggered by network disconnection or other causes, contact technical support engineers of OMS Community Edition.
