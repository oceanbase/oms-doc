# oms_host_down

## Impact on the system

When a host of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition is down, it becomes unavailable.

* If high availability is not enabled, related projects of the host fail. 

* If high availability is enabled:

   * When another host is available, related projects of the host are migrated to the available host. In addition, a migration alert is triggered to prompt you to check the migration result. 

   * When no other host is available, OMS Community Edition fails. 

## Possible causes

* The host or Docker container is down for unknown reasons. 

* The `oms_drc_supervisor` application is interrupted. You can run `supervisorctl` to check whether the application is interrupted. 

* The network is disconnected. 

## Solution

* If the `oms_drc_supervisor` application is interrupted, log on to the host and run `supervisorctl restart oms_drc_supervisor` to restart the application. If the application still fails, go to the `/home/admin/logs/supervisor` directory to view the error logs. 

* In a high-availability environment with multiple hosts, enable the `enableHost` parameter and perform migration. 

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > You can migrate only JDBCWriters and connectors but not full data. 

   To enable the `enableHost` parameter, perform the following steps:

   1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

   3. On the **System Parameters** page, find `ha.config`. 

   4. Click the edit icon in the **Value** column of the parameter. 

   5. In the **Modify Value** dialog box, change the value of `enableHost` to `true`. 

   6. Click **OK**. 

* If this alert is triggered by network disconnection or other causes, contact Technical Support of OMS Community Edition.
