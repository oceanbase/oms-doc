# oms_sync_delay

## Impact on the system

This alert affects the real-time performance of data synchronization. If this alert is left unhandled for a long time, the migration project cannot be recovered.

## Possible causes

* The source and destination databases are not properly configured.

* Privileges are not properly assigned.

* The network is disconnected.

* Other special circumstances have occurred.

## Solution

Go to the details page of the data synchronization project, and click **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner to view the timestamp information of the store and connector components.

* If the store has a high latency, check for information about errors or exceptions in its logs.

* If the timestamp information of the store is basically in real time but the connector has a high latency, check the logs of the connector for error or exception information.

* If no specific error message is found, provide the symptoms and component logs to Technical Support of OMS Community Edition.
