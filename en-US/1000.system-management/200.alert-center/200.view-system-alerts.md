# View system alerts

This topic describes the monitoring range supported by the system alert feature. This topic also describes how to view system alerts.

## Background information

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition monitors system events, such as the OMS Community Edition host failure, resource usage over thresholds, and downtime migration, and sends alerts to corresponding channels.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** \> **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alerts** page, click the **System Alert Information** tab.

   By default, the **System Alert Information** page displays alerts of the last 7 days. In the upper-right corner of the page, you can select **Last 7 Days**, **Last 3 Weeks**, **Last Month**, or **Last 3 Months** from the drop-down list to view alerts within different ranges of time. You can also enter the alert ID or message content in the search box in the upper-right corner to search for an alert.

   You can filter alerts by using the **Alert Events** and **Sending Status** columns on the **System Alert Information** page.
   * The following types of alert events are supported:

     * OMS host failure. For more information about how to handle this alert, see [oms_host_down](../../1200.reference-guide/300.alarm-reference/100.oms-host-down.md).

     * Usage of resources on the OMS host over thresholds. For more information about how to handle this alert, see [oms_host_threshold](../../1200.reference-guide/300.alarm-reference/300.oms-host-threshold.md).

     * OMS downtime migration. For more information about how to handle this alert, see [oms_host_down_migrate_resource](../../1200.reference-guide/300.alarm-reference/200.oms-host-down-migrate-resource.md).

   * An alert can be in one of the following sending status:

     * Pending: The alert is waiting for its sending to be scheduled.

     * Failed: The alert failed to be sent to the destination channel due to network issues or other unknown reasons.

     * Successful: The alert is sent to the destination channel, such as OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

     * Completed: If the alert is not triggered within 3 hours, the alert status becomes Completed.

     * Sent again: The alert is sent again because the last sending failed.

   You can also click the host node of the alert to view details on the **Server** page. For more information, see [View server information](../../900.o-m-manual/300.server/100.view-server-information.md).
