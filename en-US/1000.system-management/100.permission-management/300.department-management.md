# Manage departments

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) isolates and manages roles by department. This means that a user with the ADMIN role in a department has the read and write permissions on all projects only in this department. This topic describes how to create, modify, and delete a department as the root user.

## Limits

* You can go to the **Department Management** page only when you log on as the root user.

* A default department is provided, and you cannot modify or delete the default department.

* If a department has members, the department cannot be deleted.

* To be compatible with the ADMIN role, OMS does not limit all the system capabilities. For example, the number of components for each server and the batch operations in a component based on IP addresses are not limited.
