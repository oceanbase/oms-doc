# Deploy OMS Community Edition on multiple nodes in a single region

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition on multiple nodes in a single region by using deployment tools.

## Background

* You can deploy OMS Community Edition on a single node first and scale out to multiple nodes.

* If you choose to deploy OMS Community Edition with the `config.yaml` configuration file, note that the settings are slightly different from those for the single-node deployment mode. For more information, see the "Template and example of a configuration file" section.

* To deploy OMS Community Edition on multiple nodes, you must apply for a virtual IP address (VIP) and use it as the mount point for the OMS Community Edition console. In addition, you must configure the mapping rules of Ports 8088 and 8089 in the VIP network strategy.

   You can use the VIP to access the OMS Community Edition console even if an OMS Community Edition node fails.

## Prerequisites

* The installation environment meets the system and network requirements. For more information, see [System and network requirements](../400.deployment-guide/200.system-requirements.md).

* A MetaDB cluster is in place to serve as the metadata database of OMS Community Edition.

* Make sure that the server to deploy OMS Community Edition can connect to all other servers.

* Make sure that all servers involved in the multi-node deployment can connect to each other and that you can obtain root permissions on a node by using its username and password.

* The OMS Community Edition installation package is obtained. Generally, the package is a `tar.gz` file whose name starts with `oms`.

* The downloaded OMS Community Edition installation package has been loaded into the local image repository of the Docker container on each server node.

   ```shell
   docker load -i <OMS Community Edition installation package>
   ```

* The directory to which the OMS Community Edition container is mounted has been prepared. OMS Community Edition creates three mapping directories in this directory: `/home/admin/logs`, `/home/ds/store`, and `/home/ds/run`. These directories store the runtime components and logs of OMS Community Edition.

* (Optional) A time-series database is installed to store OMS Community Edition performance monitoring data and DDL and DML statistics.

## Concepts

You need to replace variable names in some commands and prompts. A variable name is enclosed with angle brackets (`<>`).

* Directory to which the OMS Community Edition container is mounted: See the description of the mount directory in Prerequisites.

* IP address of the server: the IP address of the host that executes the script. In a single-node deployment scenario, by default, it refers to the IP address in the cluster management (CM) configuration information.

* OMS_IMAGE: the unique identifier of the loaded image. After you load the OMS Community Edition installation package by using Docker, run the `docker images` command to obtain the [IMAGE ID] or [REPOSITORY:TAG] of the loaded image. The obtained value is the unique identifier of the loaded image. Example:

   ```shell
   $sudo docker images
   REPOSITORY                                          TAG                 IMAGE ID
   work.oceanbase-dev.com/obartifact-store/oms     feature_3.4.0       2a6a77257d35
   ```

   In this example, `<OMS_IMAGE>` can be `work.oceanbase-dev.com/obartifact-store/oms:feature_3.4.0` or `2a6a77257d35`. Replace the value of `<OMS_IMAGE>` in related commands with the preceding value.

* Directory of the `config.yaml` file: If you want to deploy OMS Community Edition based on the current `config.yaml` configuration file, this directory is the one where the current configuration file is located.

## Multi-node deployment architecture

The following figure shows an architecture of multi-node deployment. Store is the log pulling component, and Incr-Sync is the incremental synchronization component. When OMS Community Edition A fails, the Store ad Incr-Sync processes running on the node are protected by the HA service and switched to OMS Community Edition B or OMS Community Edition C.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>By default, the HA feature is disabled. To ensure the high availability of Store and Incr-Sync, enable HA in the OMS Community Edition console. For more information, see <a href="../1000.system-management/400.system-parameters/200.modify-ha-configurations.md">Modify high availability configurations</a>. </p>

## Deploy OMS Community Edition without a configuration file

1. Log on to the server where OMS Community Edition is deployed.

2. Optional. Deploy a time-series database.

   If you need to collect and display OMS Community Edition monitoring data, deploy a time-series database. Otherwise, you can skip this step. For more information, see [Deploy a time-series database](../400.deployment-guide/1000.deploy-a-time-series-database.md).

3. Run the following command to obtain the deployment script from the loaded image:

   ```shell
   sudo docker run -d --name oms-config-tool <OMS_IMAGE> bash && sudo docker cp oms-config-tool:/root/docker_remote_deploy.sh . && sudo docker rm -f oms-config-tool
   ```

   Example:

   ```shell
   sudo docker run -d --net host --name oms-config-tool work.oceanbase-dev.com/obartifact-store/oms:feature_4.0-ce bash && sudo docker cp oms-config-tool:/root/docker_remote_deploy.sh . && sudo docker rm -f oms-config-tool
   ```

4. Use the deployment script to start the deployment tool.

   ```shell
   sh docker_remote_deploy.sh -o <deploy_tool_workdir> -i <IP address of the server> -d <OMS_IMAGE>
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment. After you set each parameter, press **Enter** to move on to the next parameter.

   1. Select the deployment mode.

      Select **Multiple Nodes in Single Region**.

   2. Select the task.

      Select **No Configuration File. Deploy OMS Starting from Configuration File Generation**.

   3. Enter the following MetaDB configuration information:

      1. Enter the URL, port, username, and password of the MetaDB.

      2. Set the prefix for names of databases in the MetaDB

         For example, when the prefix is set to `oms`, the databases in the MetaDB are named `oms_rm`, `oms_cm`, and `oms_cm_hb`.

      3. Confirm your settings.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

      4. If the system displays "**The specified database names already exist in the MetaDB. Are you sure that you want to continue?**",  The message indicates that the database name you entered already exists in the MetaDB. This may be caused by repeated deployment or upgrade of OMS Community Edition. You can enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed, or enter `n` and press **Enter** to re-specify the settings.

   4. Perform the following operations to configure the CM service of OMS Community Edition:

      1. Specify the URL of the CM service, which is the VIP or domain name to which all CM servers in the region are mounted. The original parameter is `cm-url`.

         Enter the VIP or domain name as the URL of the CM service. You can separately specify the IP address and port number in the URL, or use a colon (:) to join the IP address and port number in the <IP address>:<port number> format.

         <main id="notice" type='explain'>
         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>The <code>http://</code> prefix in the URL is optional. </p>
         </main>

      2. Enter the IP addresses of all servers in the region. Separate them with commas (,).

      3. Confirm the displayed CM settings.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   5. Confirm whether to enable OMS Community Edition historical data monitoring.

      * If you have deployed a time-series database, enter `y` and press **Enter** to go to the next step to configure the time-series database and enable the monitoring of OMS Community Edition historical data.

      * If you did not deploy a time-series database, enter `n` and press **Enter** to go to the step of "determining whether to enable the audit log feature and setting Simple Log Service (SLS) parameters". In this case, OMS Community Edition does not monitor the historical data after deployment.

   6. Configure the time-series database.

      Perform the following operations:

      1. Confirm whether you have deployed a time-series database.

         Enter the value based on the actual situation. If yes, enter `y` and press **Enter**. If not, enter `n` and press **Enter** to go to the step of "determining whether to enable the audit log feature and setting SLS parameters".

      2. Set the type of the time-series database to `INFLUXDB`.

         <main id="notice" type='notice'>
         <h4>Notice</h4>
         <p>At present, only INFLUXDB is supported. </p>
         </main>

      3. Enter the URL, username, and password of the time-series database.

      4. Confirm whether the displayed settings are correct.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   7. Determine whether to enable the audit log feature and write the audit logs to Simple Log Service (SLS).

      To enable the audit log feature, enter `y` and press **Enter** to go to the next step to specify the SLS parameters.

      Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to start the deployment. In this case, OMS Community Edition does not audit the logs after deployment.

   8. Specify the following SLS parameters:

      1. Set the SLS parameters as prompted.

      2. Confirm whether the displayed settings are correct.

      If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   9. If the configuration file passes the check, all settings are displayed. If the settings are correct, enter `n` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `y` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

      If the configuration file fails the check, modify the configuration information as prompted.

   10. Start the deployment on each node one after another.

       1. Specify the directory to which the OMS Community Edition container is mounted in the host.

          Use a directory with a large capacity.

          For a remote node, the username and password for logging on to the remote node are required. The corresponding user account must have the sudo privileges on the remote node.

       2. Confirm whether the OMS Community Edition image file can be named as `OMS_IMAGE`.

          If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

       3. Confirm whether to install a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the OMS Community Edition container.

          If yes, enter `y`, press **Enter**, and specify the `https_key` and `https_crt` directories as prompted. If not, enter `n` and press **Enter**.

   11. Start the deployment on the node.

          If the deployment fails, you can log on to the running OMS container and view the `.log` file with the `docker_init` prefix in the `/home/admin/logs` directory to obtain the log. If the OMS Community Edition container fails to start, the logs cannot be obtained.
