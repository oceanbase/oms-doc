# Deploy OMS Community Edition on a single node

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition on a single node by using deployment tools.

## Prerequisites

* The installation environment meets the system requirements. For more information, see [System and network requirements](../4.deployment-guide/2.system-requirements.md).

* The MetaDB cluster is prepared as the OMS Community Edition MetaDB.

* The OMS Community Edition installation package is obtained. Generally, the package is a `tar.gz` file whose name starts with `oms`.

* The downloaded OMS Community Edition image file has been loaded to the local image repository of the Docker container.

   `docker load -i <Storage path of the OMS Community Edition image>`

   In this example, the name of the loaded image file is `OMS_IMAGE`. You need to replace it with the actual name of your image file.

## Deploy OMS Community Edition without the configuration file

1. Log on to the server where OMS Community Edition is to be deployed.

2. Optional. Deploy a time-series database.

   If you need to collect and display OMS Community Edition monitoring data, deploy a time-series database. Otherwise, you can skip this step. For more information, see [Deploy a time-series database](../4.deployment-guide/10.deploy-a-time-series-database.md).

3. Run the following command to obtain the deployment script from the loaded image:

   ```shell
   sudo docker run -d --net host --name oms-config-tool <OMS_IMAGE> bash && sudo docker cp oms-config-tool:/root/docker_remote_deploy.sh . && sudo docker rm -f oms-config-tool
   ```

4. Use the deployment script to start the deployment tool.

   ```shell
   sh docker_remote_deploy.sh -o <deploy_tool_workdir> -i <IP address of the server> -d <OMS_IMAGE>
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment. After you set each parameter, press **Enter** to move on to the next parameter.

   1. Select the deployment mode.

      Select **Single Node in Single Region**.

   2. Select the task.

      Select **No Configuration File. Deploy OMS Starting from Configuration File Generation**.

   3. Specify the following MetaDB information:

      1. IP address of the MetaDB

      2. Port number of the MetaDB

      3. Username used to connect to the MetaDB

      4. Password used to connect to the MetaDB

      5. Prefix for names of databases in the MetaDB

         For example, if you set the prefix to `oms`, the final database names are `oms_rm`, `oms_cm`, and `oms_cm_hb`.

   4. Confirm your settings.

      If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   5. If the system displays "**The specified database names already exist in the metadatabase. Are you sure that you want to continue?**",  it indicates that the database names you specified already exist in the MetaDB. This may be caused by repeated deployment or upgrade of OMS Community Edition. You can enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed, or enter `n` and press **Enter** to re-specify the settings.

   6. Perform the following operations to configure the Cluster Manager (CM) service of OMS Community Edition:

      1. Check whether the obtained default IP address is correct.

         The displayed IP address must be the same as the vale of the `<IP address of the server>` field that you specified when you start the deployment tool. If the IP address is correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify it.

      2. The page displays the OMS Community Edition cluster settings. Note that the value of the `cm_url` field must the IP address of the server. If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   7. Confirm whether to enable OMS Community Edition historical data monitoring.

      * If you have deployed a time-series database, enter `y` and press **Enter** to go to the next step to configure the time-series database and enable the monitoring of OMS Community Edition historical data.

      * If you did not deploy a time-series database, enter `n` and press **Enter** to go to the step of "determining whether to enable the audit log feature and setting Simple Log Service (SLS) parameters". In this case, OMS Community Edition does not monitor the historical data after deployment.

   8. Configure the time-series database.

      Perform the following operations:

      1. Confirm whether you have deployed a time-series database.

          If yes, enter `y` and press **Enter**. If not, enter `n` and press **Enter** to go to the step of "determining whether to enable the audit log feature and setting SLS parameters".

      2. Set the type of the time-series database to `INFLUXDB`.

         > **Notice:**
         >
         > At present, only INFLUXDB is supported.

      3. Enter the URL of the time-series database.

         You can separately enter the IP address and port number in the URL, or use a colon (:) to join the IP address and port number in the `<IP address>:<port number>` format.

      4. Enter the username used to connect to the time-series database.

      5. Enter the password used to connect to the time-series database.

      6. Confirm whether the displayed settings are correct.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   9. Determine whether to enable the audit log feature and set SLS parameters.

      To enable the audit log feature, enter `y` and press **Enter** to go to the next step to specify the SLS parameters.

      Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to start the deployment. In this case, OMS Community Edition does not audit the logs after deployment.

   10. Specify the following SLS parameters:

       1. URL of the SLS domain

       2. access-key used to access SLS

       3. secret-key used to access SLS

       4. user-site-topic of SLS

       5. ops-site-topic of SLS

       6. Confirm whether the displayed settings are correct.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   11. Perform the following operations to specify additional information that is required in the single-node deployment:

       1. Specify the username used to connect to the server.

       2. Specify the password used to connect to the server.

       3. Specify the path of the `config.yaml` file, which must end with a slash (/).

       4. Specify the root directory to which the OMS container is mounted in the host.

            Use a directory with a large capacity.

       5. Confirm whether the OMS Community Edition image file can be named as `OMS_IMAGE`.

            If yes, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify it.

       6. Confirm whether to install a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the OMS Community Edition container.

            If yes, enter `y`, press **Enter**, and specify the `https_key` and `https_crt` directories as prompted. If not, enter `n` and press **Enter**.

   12. Start the deployment.

## Deploy OMS Community Edition with the configuration file available

1. Log on to the server where OMS Community Edition is to be deployed.

2. Optional. Deploy a time-series database.

   If you need to collect and display OMS Community Edition monitoring data, deploy a time-series database. Otherwise, you can skip this step. For more information, see [Deploy a time-series database](../4.deployment-guide/10.deploy-a-time-series-database.md).

3. Run the following command to obtain the deployment script from the loaded image:

   ```shell
   sudo docker run --name oms-config-tool <OMS_IMAGE> bash && sudo docker cp oms-config-tool:/root/docker_remote_deploy.sh . && sudo docker rm -f oms-config-tool
   ```

4. Use the deployment script to start the deployment tool.

   ```shell
   sh docker_remote_deploy.sh -o <deploy_tool_workdir> -c <directory of the config.yaml file> -i <IP address of the server> -d <OMS_IMAGE>
   ```

   > **Note:**
   >
   > For more information about settings of the `config.yaml` file, see the "Template and example of the configuration file" section.

5. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment. After you set each parameter, press **Enter** to move on to the next parameter.

   1. Select the deployment mode.

      Select **Single Node in Single Region**.

   2. Select the task.
