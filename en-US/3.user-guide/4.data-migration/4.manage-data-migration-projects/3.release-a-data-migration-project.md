## Release a data migration project

After OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition completes a data migration project, you can switch the business database from the source database to the destination database, and stop and release the project.

## Limits

OMS Community Edition can release a data migration project only if the data migration project is completed or failed.

## Usage notes

After the data migration task is released, OMS Community Edition stops the current full migration and incremental migration tasks. This operation is irreversible. Proceed with caution.

However, OMS Community Edition does not delete the project. You can view details about the project or create similar data migration projects based on the project.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

3. On the **Data Migration** page, click the **More** icon next to the project that you want to release, and then click **Release** from the drop-down list.

   You can also click the project name on the **Data Migration** page to go to the details page, click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner, and click **Release** from the drop-down list.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
