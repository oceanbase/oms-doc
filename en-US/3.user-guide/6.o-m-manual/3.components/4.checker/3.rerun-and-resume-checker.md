# Rerun and recover a checker

The OPS & Monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to perform O&M operations on a checker, for example, rerun a completed checker and recover an abnormal checker. A checker consists of the Checker-Full and Checker-Verify components.

## Rerun a checker

You can rerun**** a checker in the **Completed** state.

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Checker** tab.

4. On the **Checker** tab, search for the target checker by checker name, migration project name, or server IP address.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Checker**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter checkers by region and rerun completed checkers in the target region.

5. Click **Rerun** in the **Actions** column of the target checker.

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > * For a project that has been run before, click **Rerun** to restart the task.
   >
   > * After full migration is completed and the subsequent step has started, you cannot rerun a full migration project. You can only view project configurations in the Update Configurations dialog box.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

## Recover a checker

If the first verification fails, modify the data in the destination database and try again. You can recover a checker in the **Abnormal** state.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Checker** tab.
