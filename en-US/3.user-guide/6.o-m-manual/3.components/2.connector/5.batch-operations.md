# Batch O&M

This topic describes how to start, pull data from, or delete the connectors of one server or one synchronization project in batches. Batch O&M enables you to modify the configurations of multiple connectors at a time, improving O&M efficiency. 

## Limits

Connectors can be migrated only in high availability scenarios where multiple servers are deployed. 

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition. 

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**. 

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Connector** tab. 

4. On the **Connector** tab, click **Batch O&M** in the upper-right corner. 

5. Select an operation type. The following options are available: **Stop**, **Start**, **Migrate**, **Update**, and **Delete**. 

6. Select a dimension for batch O&M. 

   You can perform batch O&M by server IP address or synchronization project. For multi-region deployment, region information is displayed in the IP address drop-down list. 

   * To update connector configurations in batches, you need to manually specify **Operation Dimension**. 

   * Both batch data pulling and configuration updates take effect for the entire server or synchronization task. 

7. Click **Submit**.
