# View details of a store

The OPS & Monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to view the basic information about a store, including the name, type, latency, and status. You can determine the running status of a store based on the basic information.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** **>** **Component**. The **Store** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** tab, view the basic information about the target store.

   You can search for a target store by store name, migration project ID, or topic.

   | Type | The type of the source database.  |
   | RPS | The number of transactions handled by the server per second. It is used to measure the system throughput.  |
