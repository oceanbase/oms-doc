# Batch O&M

To perform common O&M operations such as stop, start, and delete operations on the JDBCWriters of a server or a specific migration project, you can run batch O&M tasks. Batch O&M allows you to modify the configurations of multiple JDBCWriters at a time conveniently and efficiently.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.

4. On the **JDBCWriter** tab, click **Batch O&M** in the upper-right corner.

   For multi-region deployment, you can click the tab of the target region and view the JDBCWriters in the region.

5. In the **Batch O&M** dialog box, specify **Operation Type** and set **Operation Dimension** to the server IP address.

   For multi-region deployment, region information is displayed in the IP address drop-down list. The value of **Operation Type** can be **Stop**, **Start**, or **Delete**.

6. Click **Submit**.
