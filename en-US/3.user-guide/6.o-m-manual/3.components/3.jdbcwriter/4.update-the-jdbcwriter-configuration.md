# Update the configurations of a JDBCWriter

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to view and update the configurations of a specified JDBCWriter. When you update the configurations, the current configurations of the JDBCWriter are displayed by default. You can view and modify the configurations of the JDBCWriter.

## Application scenarios

You can update the JDBCWriter configurations in the following scenarios:

* A data migration project fails due to incorrect configuration information.

* A data migration project needs to be optimized.

## Limits

* OMS Community Edition allows you to update the configurations of only a JDBCWriter in the **Stopped** or **Abnormal** state.

* After you update the configurations of a JDBCWriter, the system restarts the JDBCWriter to apply the updates. Proceed with caution.

   When a data migration project fails, check the configurations of the project first, such as the basic information and user privileges of the source and destination databases.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.

4. On the **JDBCWriter** tab, search for the JDBCWriter that you want to pause by its name or server IP address. You can also perform a fuzzy search by migration project name or ID.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **JDBCWriter**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter JDBCWriters by region and update JDBCWriters in the target region.

5. Click **Update** on the right of the target JDBCWriter.

6. In the **Update Configurations** dialog box, hover the pointer over the parameter to be modified and click the edit icon that appears. For more information, see [JDBCWriter parameters](../../5.description-of-component-parameters/3.jdbcwriter-parameters.md).

   To add a JDBCWriter parameter, perform the following operations:

   1. In the **Update Configuration** dialog box, hover the pointer over the blank area next to the `root` parameter and click the **Add** icon.

   2. Specify the **Key Name** field and click the check mark.

   3. In the **Update Configuration** dialog box, find the new key. The default value of a new key is NULL.
