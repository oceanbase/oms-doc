|---------------------|------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| txnTable | No | None | The transaction table that prevents cyclical replication and use.  |
| txnDb | No | None | The database in which the transaction table that prevents cyclical replication and use is located.  |

| notWriteColumn | No | None | The column to which no data needs to be written.  |
| transactionIdIsLong | No | None | Specifies whether the transaction ID needs to be converted into the long type before it is written into the database. This parameter is used for compatibility with existing transaction tables.  |
| useTargetIndex | No | false | Specifies whether to use indexes of the destination database for data synchronization.  |

## Source

| Parameter | Required | Default value | Description |
|----------------|------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| cmUrl | No | None | The address of the cluster manager, which is used to obtain the connection to a store.  |
| useDRCNet | No | false | Specifies whether to use DRCNet as the transmission protocol. Set this parameter to true to improve the transmission performance.  |
| storeUsername | No | None | The username of the store.  |
| storePassword | No | None | The password of the store.  |
| srcSubTopic | No | None | The topic for pulling data from the store.  |
| blackRegionNo | No | None | The number of the region that is not involved in data migration, which is used to prevent cyclical replication.  |

| drcMarkDb | No | None | The database in which the transaction table that prevents cyclical replication and use is located.  |
| ignoreDdl | No | None | Specifies whether to ignore DDL statements.  |
| askSelfUnit | No | false | The value `false` indicates that all incremental data is to be pulled. The value `true` indicates that only data written by business is to be pulled. Set this parameter to true in active-active scenarios. |
| timestamp | No | None | The point in time for connecting to the store. It is a second-level timestamp.  |
| splitThreshold | No | 16384/workerNum | The threshold for splitting a large transaction.  |

## Forward-compatible parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default value | Description |
|------------------------|------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| src_type | No | None | The type of the source database. Valid values: mysql, oceanbase (OB05), oceanbase1 (a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database).  |
| dest_type | No | None | The type of the destination database. Set this parameter to the same value as that of `src_type`. |
| retry_time | No | 10000 | The number of retries allowed during data synchronization. The value is of the INT type.  |
| retry_sleep | No | None | The retry interval during data synchronization, in seconds. The value is of the INT type.  |

| timestamp | No | None | The timestamp of the point in time when data is pulled from the store.  |
| src_subTopic | No | None | The subtopic for connecting to the source store.  |
| ignore_ddl | No | true | Specifies whether to enable DDL synchronization. Valid values: true and false.  <ul><li>**true**: DDL synchronization is disabled.    <li>**false**: DDL synchronization is enabled.  </ul> |
| filter.db and filter.table | No | \* | The transaction table that prevents cyclical replication and use. `filter.db` is invalid when data is written to an OB05 database. In this case, `filter.table` of the migration user is used instead. |
| filter.table | No | drc_txn | The transaction table that prevents cyclical replication and use. `filter.db` is invalid when data is written to an OB05 database. In this case, `filter.table` of the migration user is used instead. |
| worker_num | No | 64 | The number of parallel write threads in the database. The value can be optimized based on the number of server cores and the number of database connections.  |
