# Add a RocketMQ data source 

You must configure data sources before you create a data migration project. To migrate data from or to a RocketMQ database, you must add the RocketMQ database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to add a RocketMQ database as a data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition. 

## Prerequisites 

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.

  

* You have created a database user for data migration. 

  We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for the data migration project and grant the required data operation privileges to the user.
  

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

   

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

   

4. In the **Add Data Source** panel, select **RocketMQ** for **Terminal Type**.

   

5. Specify the following parameters.
