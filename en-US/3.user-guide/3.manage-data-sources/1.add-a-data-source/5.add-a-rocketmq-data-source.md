# Add a RocketMQ data source

You must configure data sources before you create a data synchronization project. Before you start a data synchronization project, you must add a RocketMQ database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to add a RocketMQ database as a data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Limits

OMS Community Edition allows you to add a RocketMQ instance only as the destination for data synchronization.

## Prerequisites

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.

* You have created a database user for data synchronization.

   We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for the data synchronization project and grant the required data operation privileges to the user.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Add Data Source** dialog box, select **RocketMQ** for **Data Source Type**.

5. Specify the following parameters.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |---|---|
   | Data Source Identifier | We recommend that you set it to a combination of Chinese characters, digits, and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 32 characters in length.  |
   | Region | Select the region where the data source resides from the drop-down list. The region is the value that you set for the `cm_region` parameter when you deploy OMS Community Edition.  <br>**Notice:** <ul><li> This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available.    <li> Make sure that the mappings between the data source and the region are consistent. Otherwise, the migration and synchronization performance can be poor.  </ul> |
   | RocketMQ Endpoint Information | The endpoint of the RocketMQ database. The value is in the format of `IP address:port number` or `<domain name>:port number`. |
   | AccessKey | Optional. The AccessKey ID that you created in the RAM console for identity authentication.  |
   | SecretKey | Optional. The AccessKey secret that you created in the RAM console for identity authentication.  |
   | Remarks (Optional) | Additional information about the data source.  |

6. Click **Test Connection** to test the network connection between OMS Community Edition and the source database.

7. After the connection test is passed, click **Add**.
