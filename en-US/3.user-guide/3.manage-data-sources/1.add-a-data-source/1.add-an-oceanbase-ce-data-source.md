# Add an OceanBase Community Edition data source

You must configure data sources before you create a data migration project. Before you start a data migration project, you must add an OceanBase Community Edition database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to add an OceanBase Community Edition database as a data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.

* You have created a database user for data migration.

* You have deployed an OBProxy.

We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for the data migration project and grant the required data operation privileges to the user. For more information, see [User privileges](../../2.data-migration/2.user-permission-settings.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Add Data Source** dialog box, specify the fields. The default value of **Data Source Type** is **OceanBase-CE**.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-------------|-------------|
   | Data Source Identifier | We recommend that you set it to a combination of Chinese characters, digits, and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 32 characters in length.  |
   | Region | Select the region where the data source resides from the drop-down list. The region is the value that you set for the `cm_region` parameter when you deploy OMS Community Edition.  <br>**Notice:**  <ul><li> This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available.    <li> Make sure that the mappings between the data source and the region are consistent. Otherwise, the migration and synchronization performance can be poor.   </ul> |
   | Tenant Type | The type of tenants of OceanBase Community Edition. At present, only MySQL tenants are supported.  |
   | OCP Cluster | Optional. The OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) cluster associated with the data source. Select an OCP cluster from the drop-down list. <ul><li>Check whether the data source is managed in the selected OCP cluster. <li>This parameter ensures that OMS Community Edition obtains the incremental logs of OceanBase Community Edition. If you do not set this parameter, you cannot select Incremental Migration, Incremental Synchronization, or Reverse Incremental Migration. </ul>If the OCP cluster is not available in the list, click **Add OCP Cluster** and configure the parameters on the **Add Associated OCP Cluster** page. For more information, see [Associate with OCP](../../5.system-management/3.associate-ocp.md).  |
   | Connection Mode | Valid values: **Manual Input** and **Command-line Connection String**. <ul><li>**Manual Input**: Enter the public IP address and port number of OceanBase Community Edition.    <li>**Command-line Connection String**: Enter a command-line connection string.  |
   | Host IP Address | The IP address of the host where the database is located.  |
   | Port | The OBProxy port of the OceanBase Community Edition cluster.  |
   | Tenant Name | The name of the tenant of OceanBase Community Edition.  |
   | Cluster Name | The name of the cluster where the tenant of OceanBase Community Edition resides.  |
   | Database Username | The username of OceanBase Community Edition for data migration or synchronization. We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for data migration.  |
   | Database Password | The password of the database user.  |
   | Database Name | Optional. The name of the database.  |
   | Remarks (Optional) | Additional information about the data source.  |

5. (Optional) In the **Add Data Source** dialog box, click **Show** next to **Advanced Options** to set the parameters as needed.

   * When you create a migration project to migrate data from OceanBase Community Edition, you must perform the following operations:

      * For incremental synchronization, specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password.

      * For schema migration, specify the username and password.

      * For the migration of a table without a unique key, specify the password of `_OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER`.

   * When you create a migration project to migrate data to OceanBase Community Edition, you must specify the ConfigUrl, username, and password for reverse incremental migration.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |---|---|
      | Configurl | Optional. The actual IP address of the server that runs OceanBase Community Edition. <ul><li>If you have specified OCP Cluster, this parameter is not displayed. OMS Community Edition obtains the ConfigUrl from the OCP cluster to which the server belongs by default. <li>If you did not specify **OCP Cluster**, you can specify the **Username** and **Password** parameters, click **Search in OBServer** next to the ConfigUrl field to obtain the IP address from the corresponding OBServer. <br>If the query fails, you can run the `show parameters like 'obconfig_url'` command in the sys tenant of OceanBase Community Edition. The returned value is the ConfigUrl.  |
      | Username | Optional. It is the value specified for the `drc_user` parameter in the `config.yaml` file when you deploy OMS Community Edition. <br>The user reads the incremental logs of OceanBase Community Edition and obtains database schemas. You must create the user in the sys tenant.  |
      | Password | Optional. It is the password of the `drc_user` parameter. |
      | _OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER Password | Optional. The `_OCEANBASE_INNER_DRC_USER` password is required for migrating tables without unique keys.  |

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the network connection between OMS Community Edition and the data source, as well as the validity of the username and password.

7. After the connection test is passed, click **Add**.
