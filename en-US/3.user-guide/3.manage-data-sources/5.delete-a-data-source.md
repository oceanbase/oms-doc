# Delete a data source

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to delete data sources that you have created. This operation does not affect your database or the projects that are using the database for data migration or synchronization.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click the **More** icon in the **Actions** column of the data source that you want to delete, and then choose **Delete** from the drop-down list.

   If your business system is deployed in multiple regions, you can use the **Region** column to filter and delete the data sources in a specific region.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **Delete**.
