# Copy a data source

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to create a data source by copying an existing one. This feature helps you create similar data sources. This topic describes how to copy a data source.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click the **More** icon in the **Actions** column of the data source that you want to copy, and then choose **Copy** from the drop-down list.
