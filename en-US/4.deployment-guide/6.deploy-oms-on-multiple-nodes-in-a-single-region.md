# Deploy OMS Community Edition on multiple nodes in a single region

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition on multiple nodes in a single region by using deployment tools.

## Background

* You can deploy OMS Community Edition on a single node first and scale out to multiple nodes.

* If you choose to deploy OMS Community Edition with the `config.yaml` configuration file, note that the settings are slightly different from those for the single-node deployment mode. For more information, see the "Template and example of the configuration file" section.

* To deploy OMS Community Edition on multiple nodes, you must apply for a virtual IP address (VIP) and use it as the mount point for the OMS Community Edition console. In addition, you must configure the mapping rules of Ports 8088 and 8089 in the VIP network strategy.

   You can use the VIP to access the OMS Community Edition console even if an OMS Community Edition node fails.

## Prerequisites

* The installation environment meets the system requirements. For more information, see [System and network requirements](../4.deployment-guide/2.system-requirements.md).

* The MetaOB cluster is prepared as the OMS Community Edition MetaDB.

* The OMS Community Edition installation package is obtained. Generally, the package is a `tar.gz` file whose name starts with `oms`.

* Make sure that the server to deploy OMS Community Edition can connect to all other servers.

* The downloaded OMS Community Edition image file has been loaded to the local image repository of the Docker container on each server node.

   `docker load -i <Storage path of the OMS Community Edition image>`

   In this example, the name of the loaded image file is `OMS_IMAGE`. You need to replace it with the actual name of your image file.

* Make sure that all servers involved in the multi-node deployment can connect to each other and that you can obtain root permissions on a node by using its username and password.

## Multi-node deployment architecture

The following figure shows an architecture of multi-node deployment. Store is the log pulling component, and JDBCWriter and Connector are real-time synchronization components. When the OMS Community Edition A fails, store, JDBCWriter, and connector processes running on the node are protected by the HA service and switched to OMS Community Edition B or OMS Community Edition C.

> **Notice:**
>
> By default, the high availability feature is disabled. To ensure the high availability of stores, JDBCWriters, and connectors, enable HA in the OMS Community Edition console. For more information, see [Modify HA configurations](../10.system-management/4.system-parameters/2.modify-ha-configurations.md).

## Deploy OMS Community Edition without the configuration file

1. Log on to the server where OMS Community Edition is to be deployed.

2. Optional. Deploy a time-series database.

   If you need to collect and display OMS Community Edition monitoring data, deploy a time-series database. Otherwise, you can skip this step. For more information, see [Deploy a time-series database](../4.deployment-guide/10.deploy-a-time-series-database.md).

3. Run the following command to obtain the deployment script from the loaded image:

   ```shell
   sudo docker run -d --name oms-config-tool <OMS_IMAGE> bash && sudo docker cp oms-config-tool:/root/docker_remote_deploy.sh . && sudo docker rm -f oms-config-tool
   ```

4. Use the deployment script to start the deployment tool.

   ```shell
   sh docker_remote_deploy.sh -o <deploy_tool_workdir> -i <IP address of the server> -d <OMS_IMAGE>
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment. After you set each parameter, press **Enter** to move on to the next parameter.

   1. Select the deployment mode.

      Select **Multiple Nodes in Single Region**.

   2. Select the task.

      Select **No Configuration File. Deploy OMS Starting from Configuration File Generation**.

   3. Specify the following MetaDB information:

      1. IP address of the MetaDB

      2. Port number of the MetaDB

      3. Username used to connect to the MetaDB

      4. Password used to connect to the MetaDB

      5. Prefix for names of databases in the MetaDB

         For example, if you set the prefix to `oms`, the final database names are `oms_rm`, `oms_cm`, and `oms_cm_hb`.

   4. Confirm your settings.

      If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   5. If the system displays "**The specified database names already exist in the metadatabase. Are you sure that you want to continue?**",  it indicates that the database names you specified already exist in the MetaDB. This may be caused by repeated deployment or upgrade of OMS Community Edition. You can enter `y` and press Enter to proceed, or enter `n` and press Enter to re-specify the settings.

   6. Perform the following operations to configure the Cluster Manager (CM) service of OMS:

      1. Specify the URL of the CM service, which is the virtual IP address (VIP) or domain name to which all CM servers in the region are mounted. The original parameter is `cm-url`.

          You can separately specify the IP address and port number in the URL, or use a colon (:) to join the IP address and port number in the `<IP address>:<port number>` format.

         > **Note:**
         >
         > The `http://` prefix in the URL is optional.

      2. Enter the IP addresses of all servers in the region. Separate them with commas (,).

      3. Confirm the displayed CM settings.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   7. Confirm whether to enable OMS Community Edition historical data monitoring.

      * If you have deployed a time-series database, enter `y` and press **Enter** to go to the next step to configure the time-series database and enable the monitoring of OMS Community Edition historical data.

      * If you did not deploy a time-series database, enter `n` and press **Enter** to go to the step of "determining whether to enable the audit log feature and setting Simple Log Service (SLS) parameters". In this case, OMS Community Edition does not monitor the historical data after deployment.

   8. Configure the time-series database.

      Perform the following operations:

      1. Confirm whether you have deployed a time-series database.

          If yes, enter `y` and press Enter. If not, enter `n` and press Enter to go to the step of "determining whether to enable the audit log feature and setting SLS parameters".

      2. Set the type of the time-series database to `INFLUXDB`.

         > **Notice:**
         >
         > At present, only INFLUXDB is supported.

      3. Enter the URL of the time-series database.

         You can separately enter the IP address and port number in the URL, or use a colon (:) to join the IP address and port number in the `<IP address>:<port number>` format.

      4. Enter the username used to connect to the time-series database.

      5. Enter the password used to connect to the time-series database.

      6. Confirm whether the displayed settings are correct.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   9. Determine whether to enable the audit log feature and set SLS parameters.

      To enable the audit log feature, enter `y` and press **Enter** to go to the next step to specify the SLS parameters.

      To start deployment on each node, enter `n` and press **Enter** to go to the step of "starting the deployment on each node one after another". In this case, OMS Community Edition does not audit the logs after deployment.

   10. Specify the following SLS parameters:

       1. URL of SLS

       2. access-key used to access SLS

       3. secret-key used to access SLS

       4. user-site-topic of SLS

       5. ops-site-topic of SLS

       6. Confirm whether the displayed settings are correct.

         If the settings are correct, enter `y` and press **Enter** to proceed. Otherwise, enter `n` and press **Enter** to modify the settings.

   11. Start the deployment on each node one after another.

   12. Perform the following operations to specify additional information that is required for the deployment on a node:

       1. Enter the username used to connect to the server.

       2. Enter the password used to connect to the server.

       3. Specify the path of the `config.yaml` file, which must end with a slash (/).

       4. Specify the root directory to which the OMS container is mounted in the host.

          Use a directory with a large capacity.

       5. Confirm whether the OMS image file can be named as `OMS_IMAGE`.

          If yes, enter `y` and press **Enter**. If not, enter `n` and press **Enter**.

       6. Confirm whether to install a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate for the OMS container.

          If yes, enter `y`, press **Enter**, and specify the `https_key` and `https_crt` directories as prompted. If not, enter `n` and press **Enter**.

   13. Repeat the operations in the previous step on each node until the deployment is completed on all nodes.

## Deploy OMS Community Edition with the configuration file available

1. Log on to the server where OMS Community Edition is to be deployed.

2. Optional. Deploy a time-series database.

   If you need to collect and display OMS Community Edition monitoring data, deploy a time-series database. Otherwise, you can skip this step. For more information, see [Deploy a time-series database](../4.deployment-guide/10.deploy-a-time-series-database.md).

3. Run the following command to obtain the deployment script from the loaded image:

   ```shell
   sudo docker run -d --name oms-config-tool <OMS_IMAGE> bash && sudo docker cp oms-config-tool:/root/docker_remote_deploy.sh . && sudo docker rm -f oms-config-tool
   ```

4. Use the deployment script to start the deployment tool.

   ```shell
   sh docker_remote_deploy.sh -o <deploy_tool_workdir> -c <directory of the config.yaml file> -i <IP address of the server> -d <OMS_IMAGE>
   ```
