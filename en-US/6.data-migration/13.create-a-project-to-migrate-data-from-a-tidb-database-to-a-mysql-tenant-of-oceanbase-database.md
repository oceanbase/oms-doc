# Migrate data from a TiDB database to OceanBase Community Edition

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to migrate data from a TiDB database to an OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode.

## Limits

* Only TiDB 4.x and 5.4 are supported.

* In long-term synchronization between databases, OMS Community Edition does not support triggers in the destination database.

* OMS Community Edition does not support the migration of a table without a primary key from a TiDB database to OceanBase Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition does not support the migration of data with spaces from a TiDB database to OceanBase Community Edition.

* If the character set used by the source database is UTF-8, we recommend that you use UTF-8 or a greater character set for the destination database.

* During reverse incremental migration from a TiDB database to OceanBase Community Edition, if the database contains a multi-partition table that has a globally unique index, data may be lost during migration if you update the value of the partitioning key of the table.

* Do not write data into topics synchronized by TiCDC. Otherwise, a JDBC-connector exception will occur and an error that indicates a null pointer will be returned.

* OMS Community Edition supports only the TiCDC Open Protocol. If you use an unsupported protocol, a JDBC-connector exception will occur and an error that indicates a null pointer will be returned.

* When the length of a field in the destination database is shorter than that in the source database, the data of this field will be truncated in the destination database, causing data inconsistency between the source and destination databases.

## Create a data migration project

1. Create a migration project.

   1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Migration**.

   3. On the **Data Migration** page, click **Create Migration Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Migration Project Name | We recommend that you set it to a combination of Chinese characters, digits, and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Label | Click the field and select the target tag from the drop-down list. You can click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data migration projects](../6.data-migration/15.manage-data-migration-projects/3.use-tags-to-manage-data-migration-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a TiDB data source, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create a TiDB data source](../8.create-and-manage-data-sources/1.create-a-data-source/4.create-a-tidb-data-source.md).<br>  **Notice**<br>If the TiDB data source is not bound to a valid Kafka data source or a topic, incremental synchronization is not supported.  |
   | Destination | If you have created a data source for the MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, select it from the drop-down list. If you have not created a data source, click **Create Data Source** in the drop-down list and create a data source in the dialog box that appears on the right. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../8.create-and-manage-data-sources/1.create-a-data-source/1.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |

3. Click **Next**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   Note that this project supports only tables with a primary key or a non-null unique index and other tables are automatically filtered out.

5. On the **Select Migration Type** page, specify related parameters.

   Options are available for **Migration Type** include **Schema Migration**, **Full Migration**, **Incremental Synchronization**, **Full Verification**, and **Reverse Incremental Migration**.

   | Migration type | Limits |
   |------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Full Migration | If you select **Full Migration**, we recommend that you use the `ANALYZE` statement to collect the statistics of the TiDB database before data migration.  |
   | Incremental Synchronization | **Incremental Synchronization** supports the following **DML operations**: `Insert`, `Delete`, and `Update`. You can select the operations based on your business needs. If you create a TiDB data source without binding it to a Kafka data source, you cannot select **Incremental Synchronization**.  |
   | Full Verification | <ul><li> If you select **Full Verification**, we recommend that you collect the statistics of the TiDB database and the OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode before full verification.    <li>If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** but did not select all DML statements in **DML Synchronization**, OMS Community Edition does not support full data verification in this scenario. </ul> |
   | Reverse Incremental Migration | You cannot select **Reverse Incremental Migration** in the following cases: <ul><li> Multi-table aggregation and synchronization are enabled.    <li>Multiple schemas are configured in a rule to match one type of objects.   </ul> |

6. (Optional) Click **Next**. If you select **Reverse Incremental Migration** but the ConfigUrl, username, or password is not configured for the data source of the destination MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, the **More about Data Sources** dialog box appears, prompting you to configure related parameters. For more information, see [Create OceanBase-CE data source](../8.create-and-manage-data-sources/1.create-a-data-source/1.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

7. Click **Next**. On the **Select Migration Objects** page, select the migration objects and migration scope.

   You can select one of the following two modes to migrate objects: **Specify Objects** or **Match Rules**.

   * Select **Specify Objects**. Then select the objects to be migrated on the left and click **>** to add them to the list on the right. You can select tables and views of one or more databases as the migration objects.

      > **Notice**
      >
      > * The name of a table to be migrated and the names of columns in the table must not contain Chinese characters.
      >
      > * If the database or table name contains a double dollar sign ($$), you cannot create the migration project.

      When you migrate data from a TiDB database to an OceanBase database in MySQL tenant mode, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects through text, rename object names,  and remove a single or all migration objects.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.    <li>In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.<br>  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.   <li>In the **Import Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be migrated. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](../6.data-migration/15.manage-data-migration-projects/4.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).    <li> Click **Validate**.    <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**. </ol> |
      | Rename | <ol><li> In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object.   <li> Click **Rename**.    <li> Enter a new name and click **OK**.   </ol> |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove one or more objects from the destination database during data mapping.  <ul><li>Remove a single migration object <br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**. The migration object is removed.   <li> Remove all migration objects <br>In the list on the right of the **Specify Migration Scope** section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all migration objects. </ul> |

   * Select **Match Rules**. For more information, see [Configure matching rules for migration objects](../6.data-migration/21.configure-matching-rules-for-migration-objects.md).

8. Click **Next**. On the **Migration Options** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |----|----------------------------------|
   | Concurrency for Full Migration | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. The amount of resources to be consumed by a full data migration task varies based on the migration performance.  <br>You can also modify the configurations of the checker component to customize the concurrency.  <br>**Notice**<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Full Verification Concurrency | The value can be **Smooth**, **Normal**, or **Fast**. Different quantities of resources of the source and destination databases are consumed at different concurrencies. <br>You can also modify the configurations of the checker component to customize the concurrency.  |
   | Incremental Record Retention Time | The duration that incremental parsed files are cached in OMS Community Edition. A longer retention period indicates more disk space occupied by the store component of OMS Community Edition.  |
   | Whether to Allow Destination Table to Be Not Empty During Full Migration | If destination tables are allowed to be not empty during full migration, full verification is performed in `IN` mode.  <br>**Notice**<br>To enable this feature, select **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.  |
   | Whether to Allow Post-indexing | You can specify whether to allow post-indexing after full migration is completed. Post-indexing can shorten the time of full migration. <br>**Notice**<ul><li>To enable this feature, select both **Schema Migration** and **Full Migration** on the **Select Migration Type** page.   <li>Only non-unique key indexes can be created after the migration is completed. </ul> |

9. Click **Precheck** to start a precheck on the data migration project.

   During the precheck****, OMS Community Edition checks the read and write privileges of the database users and the network connections of the databases. The data migration project can be started only after it passes all check items. If an error is returned:

   * You can troubleshoot the error and run the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the Actions column of the precheck item that returns the error. Then, a dialog box appears, indicating the impact that may be caused if you choose to skip this check item. If you want to continue, click **OK** in the dialog box.

10. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data migration project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify migration objects when a data migration project is running. For more information, see [View and modify migration objects](../6.data-migration/15.manage-data-migration-projects/2.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md). After a data migration project is started, the migration objects will be executed based on the selected migration type. For more information, see the "View migration details" section in the [View details of a data migration project](../6.data-migration/15.manage-data-migration-projects/1.view-details-of-a-data-migration-project.md).
