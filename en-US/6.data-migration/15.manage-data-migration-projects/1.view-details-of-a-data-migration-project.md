   OMS Community Edition allows you to download the configurations of data migration projects in batches. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of migration objects](../15.manage-data-migration-projects/4.download-and-import-the-settings-of-migration-objects.md).

## View migration details

The **Migration Details** section displays the status, progress, start time, completion time, and total time spent of all subtasks of the current project.

* **Schema migration**

   The definitions of data objects, such as tables, indexes, constraints, comments, and views, are migrated from the source database to the destination database. Temporary tables are automatically filtered out.

   If the source database is not an OceanBase database, OMS Community Edition performs format conversion and encapsulation based on the syntax definition and standard of the tenant type of the destination OceanBase database and then replicates the data to the destination database.

   On the **Schema Migration** page, you can view the overall status, start time, end time, and total time consumed of the schema migration, as well as the migration progresses of databases, tables, and views. You can perform the following operations on an object:

  * View Creation Syntax: On the **Database** or **Table** tab, click **View** next to the target object to view the creation syntax of a database, table, or index.

      Compatible DDL syntax executed on the OBServer is displayed. Incompatible syntax is converted before it is displayed.

  * Modify Creation Syntax and Try Again: View the error information, check and modify the definition of the conversion result of a failed DDL statement, and then migrate the data to the destination again.

  * Retry/Retry All Failed Objects: You can retry failed schema migration tasks one by one or retry all failed tasks at a time.

  * Skip/Batch Skip: You can skip failed schema migration tasks one by one or skip multiple failed tasks at a time. To skip multiple objects at a time, select the objects and click **Batch Skip** in the upper-right corner. If you skip an object, its index is also skipped.

  * Remove/Batch Remove: You can remove failed schema migration tasks one by one or remove multiple failed tasks at a time. To remove multiple failed tasks at a time, select the tasks and click **Batch Remove** in the upper-right corner. If you remove an object, its index is also removed.

  * View Database Return Code: You can view the DDL statements executed on the OBServer and the execution error information of a failed schema migration task.

* **Full migration**

   The existing data is migrated from tables in the source database to the corresponding tables in the destination database. On the **Full Migration** tab, you can filter by the source or destination database, or select **View Objects with Errors** to view the objects that block the overall migration progress. You can also view related information on the **Table Objects**, **Table Indexes**, and **Full Migration Performance** tabs. The status of the full migration task changes to Completed only after the table objects and table indexes are migrated.

  * On the **Table Objects** tab, you can view the names, source and destination databases, estimated data volumes, migrated data volumes, and statuses of tables.

  * On the **Table Indexes** tab, you can view the table objects, source and destination databases, creation time, end time, time consumed, and status. You can also view the index creation syntax and remove unwanted indexes.

  * On the **Full Migration Performance** tab, you can view the graphs of performance data such as the RPS and migration traffic of the source database and destination database, average read time and average sharding time of the source database, average write time of the destination database, and performance benchmarks. Such information can help you identify performance issues in a timely manner.

   You can combine full migration with incremental synchronization to ensure data consistency between the source and destination databases. If any objects fail to be migrated during a full migration, the causes of the failure are displayed.

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > * If you did not select **Schema Migration** for **Migration Type**, OMS Community Edition migrates the fields in the source database that match those in the destination database during full migration, without checking whether the table structures are consistent.
   >
   > * After the full migration is completed and the subsequent procedure is started, you cannot choose **O&M and Monitoring** \> **Component** \> **Checker** and click **Rerun** on the **Checker** page.

* **Incremental synchronization**

   Changed data in the source database is synchronized to the corresponding tables in the destination database after an incremental synchronization task starts. Data changes are data addition, modification, and deletion. When services continuously write data to the source database, OMS Community Edition starts the incremental data pull module to pull incremental data from the source instance, parses and encapsulates the incremental data, and then stores the data in OMS Community Edition. After that, OMS Community Edition starts the full data migration.

   After the full data migration task is completed, OMS Community Edition starts the incremental data replay module to pull incremental data from the incremental data pull module. The incremental data is synchronized to the destination instance after being filtered, mapped, and converted. If you execute a DDL statement in the source database and cause a JDBCWriter exception, which then cause the data migration project to fail, the DDL statement and the Skip button are displayed. You can click **Skip** in the dialog box that appears and confirm your operation.

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > This operation may lead to data structure inconsistency between the source and destination databases. Proceed with caution.

   For a **Running** data migration project, you can view its latency, current timestamp, and incremental synchronization performance in the incremental synchronization section. The latency is displayed in the following format: X seconds (updated Y seconds ago). Normally, Y is less than 20.

   For a **Paused** or **Failed** data migration project, you can enable the DDL/DML statistic feature to collect statistics on the database operations performed after this feature is enabled, You can also view the specific information about incremental synchronization objects and the incremental synchronization performance.

  * The **Synchronization Object Statistics** tab displays the statistics about DML statements executed for each incremental synchronization object in the current project. The numbers displayed in the **Change Sum**, **Delete**, **Insert**, and **Update** fields in the section above the **Synchronization Object Statistics** tab are the sum of the corresponding columns on this tab.

  * The **Incremental Synchronization Performance** tab displays the following content:

    * Latency: the latency in synchronizing incremental data from the source database to the destination database, in seconds.

    * Migration traffic: the traffic throughput of incremental data synchronization from the source database to the destination database, in Kbit/s.

    * Average execution time: the average execution time of an SQL statement, in ms.

    * Average commit time: the average commit time of a transaction, in ms.

    * RPS: the number of records processed per second.

   When you create a data migration project, we recommend that you specify related information such as the alert level and alert frequency, to help you understand the project status. OMS Community Edition applies low-level protection by default. You can modify the alert level based on business needs. For more information, see [Alert settings](../../10.system-management/2.alert-center/3.manage-alert-settings.md).

  * When the incremental synchronization latency exceeds the specified alert threshold, the incremental synchronization status stays at Running and the system does not trigger any alerts.

  * When the incremental synchronization latency is less than or equal to the specified alert threshold, the incremental synchronization status changes from Running to Monitoring. After the incremental synchronization status changes to Monitoring, it will not change back to Running when the latency exceeds the specified alert threshold.

* **Full verification**

   After the full data migration and incremental data migration are completed, OMS Community Edition automatically initiates a full data verification task to verify the data tables in the source and destination databases.

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > * If you did not select **Schema Migration** for **Migration Type**, OMS Community Edition verifies the fields in the source database that match those in the destination database during full verification, without checking whether the table structures are consistent.
   >
   > * During the full data verification, if you perform the `create`, `drop`, `alter`, or `rename` operation on the source tables, the full data verification may exit.

   OMS also provides APIs for you to initiate custom data verification tasks during incremental data synchronization.

   On the **Full Verification** page, you can view the overall status, start time, end time, total consumed time, estimated total number of rows, number of migrated rows, real-time traffic, and RPS of the full verification.

   The **Full Verification** page contains the **Verified Objects** and **Full Verification Performance** tabs.

  * On the **Verified Objects** tab, you can view the verification progress and verification object list.

    * You can view the names, source and destination databases, full data verification progress and results, and result summary of all migration objects.

    * You can filter migration objects by source or destination database.

    * You can select **View Completed Objects Only** to view the basic information of objects that have completed schema migration, such as the object names.

    * You can choose **Reverify** > **Restart Full Verification** to run a full verification again for all migration objects.

    * For tables with inconsistent verification results:

         If you need to reverify all data in the tables, choose **Reverify** > **Reverify Abnormal Table**.

         If you need to reverify only inconsistent data, choose **Reverify** > **Verify Only Inconsistent Records**.

         > **Notice:**
         >
         > The correction operation is not supported if the source database has no corresponding data.

  * On the **Full Verification Performance** tab, you can view the graphs of performance data such as the RPS and verification traffic of the source and destination databases and performance benchmarks. Such information can help you identify performance issues in a timely manner.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to skip full verification for a project that is being verified or has failed verification. On the **Full Verification** page, click **Skip Full Verification** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > If you skip full verification, you cannot recover this verification task for data comparison or correction. In this case, you must clone the current project and initiate full verification again. Proceed with caution.

   After the full verification is completed, you can click **Go To Next Stage** to start a forward switchover. After you enter the switchover process, you cannot recheck the current verification task to compare or correct data.

* **Forward switchover**

   Forward switchover is an abstract and standard process of traditional system cutover and does not involve the switchover of application connections. This process includes a series of tasks that are performed by OMS Community Edition for the application switchover in a data migration project. You need to make sure that the entire forward switchover process is completed before the application connections are switched over to the destination database.

   Forward switchover will be performed if you choose to perform data migration. During forward switchover, you need to terminate forward incremental synchronization, delete the additional columns and unique indexes that the migration depends on, add the CHECK constraint that was filtered out by OMS Community Edition during the synchronization, and activate the triggers and foreign keys in the destination database to ensure the data integrity and availability of the destination database. Objects such as triggers and foreign keys are disabled before the migration to avoid data inconsistency.

   If reverse incremental migration is configured, the subtasks for starting reverse incremental migration and disabling triggers and foreign keys in the source database are included in the forward switchover process. This enables you to start real-time incremental synchronization from the destination database to the source database. This ensures that the business data flows back to the source database and allows application switchover at any time.

   1. Start the forward switchover

      This step does not stop the migration. You only need to confirm the switchover process that is about to start. To start the forward switchover task, click **Start Forward Switchover**.

      > **Notice:**
      >
      > Before you start the forward switchover task, make sure that the data source of the source is about to stop writing or has stopped writing.

   2. Perform switchover precheck

      Check whether the current project status supports switchover. The precheck involves the following steps:

      * Check the synchronization latency: If the synchronization latency is within 15 seconds after incremental synchronization is started, the switchover passes this check item. If incremental synchronization is not started, the switchover automatically passes this check item.

      * Check the user write privilege on the source side.

      If the switchover passes the precheck, the system automatically performs the next step. If the switchover fails the precheck, the system shows the error details.

      In this case, you can retry or skip the precheck.

      After you click **Skip**, you must also click **Skip** in the dialog box that appears.

   3. Start the destination Store

      Start incremental data pulling in the destination database. Create and start a destination Store. If the start fails, you can choose to click **Retry** or **Skip**.

   4. Confirm that writing has stopped in the source database

      In the **Make sure that writing is stopped at the source** section, click **OK** to make sure that no incremental data is generated in the source database.

   5. Confirm the writing stop timestamp upon synchronization completion

      OMS Community Edition automatically checks whether the source and destination databases are synchronized to the same timestamp. After the check is completed, the latency and timestamp of the incremental synchronization are displayed. If the synchronization of incremental data is not completed, you can choose to retry or skip.

   6. Stop forward synchronization

      Stop the JDBCWriter from the source database to the destination database. If the forward synchronization fails to be stopped, you can click **Retry** or **Skip**.

   7. Process database objects

      In this step, the database objects are migrated, the additional columns and indexes added by OMS Community Edition are deleted, and the constraints that are automatically ignored during the schema migration are added. You must also confirm that objects such as triggers and sequences have been manually migrated and that the triggers and foreign keys of the source are disabled.

      You need to click **Run** to process the database objects. For a running project, the **View Logs** or **Skip** options are provided in the **Actions** column. For manually handled projects, you need to click **Mark as Complete**. After all projects have been marked as completed, proceed to the next step.

   8. Start reverse incremental migration

      In the **Start Reverse Incremental Migration** section, click **Start Reverse Incremental Migration** to start the JDBCWriter from the destination database to the source database. Wait until the "Reverse incremental migration started" message appears.

* **Reverse incremental migration**

   For a **Running** data migration project, you can view its latency, current timestamp, and reverse incremental migration performance in the reverse incremental migration section. The latency is displayed in the following format: X seconds (updated Y seconds ago). Normally, Y is less than 20.

   For a **Paused** or **Failed** data migration project, you can enable the DDL/DML statistic feature to collect statistics on the database operations performed after this feature is enabled, You can also view the specific information about reverse migration objects and the reverse incremental migration performance.

   The performance metrics of reverse incremental migration:

  * **Latency**: the time consumed to synchronize changed incremental data from the destination database to the source database, in seconds.

  * **Migration Traffic**: the traffic throughput of incremental data synchronization from the destination database to the source database, in KB/s.

## View the component monitoring metrics

On the details page of the data migration project, click **View Component Monitoring** to view the information about the Store, JDBCWriter, Checker-Full, and Checker-Verify components. You can perform the following operations on the components:

* Start the component: Click **Start** in the Actions column of the component that you want to start. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

* Pause the component: Click **Pause** in the Actions column of the component that you want to pause. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

* Update the component: click **Update** next to the component you want to update. On the **Update Configuration** page, modify the configurations and click **Update**.

   > **Notice:**
   >
   > The system restarts after you update the component. Proceed with caution.
