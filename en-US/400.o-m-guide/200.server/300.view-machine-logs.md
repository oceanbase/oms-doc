# View server logs 

If you encounter a fault or a high latency during a data migration or synchronization task, you can view the logs of the specific server components for troubleshooting. OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition enables you to view the logs of server components in a safe, efficient, and visualized way without logging on to the server. 

## Prerequisites 

You have identified the components that are in error and obtained the IP address of the corresponding server. The underlying component name of the task resource contains the IP address of the server to which it belongs.

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Server**.

3. Click **View Logs** in the Actions column of the target server. 

4. Specify **Log Location**. 

   * You can enter the name of the folder where the logs are stored to view all log files in the folder.
   
   * You can enter the path and the name of a log file to view its details.

5. Click **Search**. 

   The latest 1000 log entries are displayed. To refresh the logs, click **Search** again. 

   You can also download and copy logs.
