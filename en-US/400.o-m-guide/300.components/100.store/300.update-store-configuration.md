# Update the configurations of a store 

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to view and update the configurations of a specified store. When you update the configurations, the current configurations of the store are displayed by default. You can view or modify the configurations of the store. 

## Limits 

* OMS Community Edition allows you to update the configurations of a running, stopped, or abnormal store. 

  >**Notice**
  >
  >Store configurations are usually updated in optimization or emergency scenarios. Exercise caution when you perform this operation.

* If the new configurations are incorrect, the store may fail to run properly, and the corresponding data migration or synchronization task may fail. We recommend that you modify store configurations only when absolutely necessary and contact technical support engineers for assistance.

  

* After you update the configurations of a store, the system will restart the store for the update to take effect. Proceed with caution.


## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**. The **Store** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** page, click **Update** in the Actions column of the target store. 

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Store**.
   
   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter stores by region and update the configurations of stores in the target region.

4. In the **Update Configurations** dialog box, hover the pointer over the parameter to be modified and click the edit icon that appears.

6. Click **Update**. 

   >**Notice**
   >
   >The updated configurations are synchronized to the topic by default and will be used in subsequent store startups. 

   For example, a data migration project has N stores, where N is greater than or equal to 1. If you update the configurations of one of the stores, the execution follows the following logic, and the configurations of other stores remain unchanged: 

   1. The configurations of the store are updated.

   
   2. The configurations of the subtopics corresponding to the store are updated.
