# Migrate a JDBCWriter 

This topic describes how to migrate a JDBCWriter to a new server in high availability scenarios. 

## Usage notes 

You can migrate only a JDBCWriter in the **Stopped** or **Abnormal** state.

 
## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

   

3. On the **Components** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.

   

4. On the **JDBCWriter** page, search for the target JDBCWriter by its name or server IP address. You can also perform a fuzzy search by migration project name or ID. 

5. Click **...** in the Actions column of the target JDBCWriter, and then select **Migrate**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, confirm the value of **Object** and choose whether to specify **Node** based on the business requirements. 

   * If you have specified the node, ignore the tag and quota information of the server. Make sure that the server can run JDBCWriter.

     
   
   * If you have not specified the node, the system automatically uses the server that have not reached the performance bottleneck for migration. However, the server is not necessarily the one with the lowest usage.


7. Click **Migrate**.
