# Batch O\&M 

To perform common O\&M operations such as stop, start, and delete operations on the JDBCWriters for the entire host or for specific migration tasks, you can run batch O\&M tasks. Batch O\&M allow you to modify the configurations of multiple JDBCWriters at a time conveniently and efficiently. 

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

   

3. On the **Components** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.

   

4. On the **JDBCWriter** page, click **Batch O\&M** in the upper-right corner. For multi-region deployment, you can click the tab of the target region and view the JDBCWriters in the region.

   

5. In the **Batch O\&M** dialog box, specify **Operation Type** and set **Operation Dimension** to the server IP address. 

   For multi-region deployment, region information is displayed in the IP address drop-down list. The value of **Operation Type** can be **Stop**, **Start**, or **Delete**.
   

6. Click **Submit**.
