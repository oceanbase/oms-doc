# Update the configurations of a JDBCWriter 

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to view and update the configurations of a specified JDBCWriter. When you update the configurations, the current configurations of the JDBCWriter are displayed by default. You can view and modify the configurations of the JDBCWriter. 

## Scenarios 

You can update the JDBCWriter configurations in the following scenarios:

* The data migration task fails because the configuration information is incorrect.

* The data migration task needs to be optimized.

## Limits 

* OMS Community Edition allows you to update the configurations of only a stopped or abnormal JDBCWriter.

  

* After you update the configurations of a JDBCWriter, the system restarts the JDBCWriter to apply the updates. Proceed with caution. 

  If a data migration task fails, check the configurations of the task first, such as the basic information and user privileges of the source and destination databases.
  

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

   

3. On the **Components** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.
