# Update the configurations of a connector 

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to view and update the configurations of a specified connector. When you update the configurations, the current configurations of the connector are displayed by default. You can view or modify the configurations of the connector. 

## Limits 

* OMS Community Edition allows you to update the configurations of only a stopped or abnormal connector.

* After you update the configurations of a connector, the system will restart the connector to apply the updates. Proceed with caution. 

  When a data synchronization project fails, check the configurations of the project first. For example, check the basic information and user privileges of the source and destination databases.
  

* Some connector configurations cannot be modified. If these configurations are modified, errors will be generated in the corresponding ticket. 

  The source address, subtopics, and destination address cannot be modified.
 
## Scenarios 

You can update connector configurations in the following scenarios:

* A data synchronization project fails due to incorrect configuration information.

  

* A data synchronization project needs to be optimized.
