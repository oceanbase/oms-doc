# Migrate a connector 

The O\&M and monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to migrate a Connector component in high availability scenarios. 

## Limits 

* If no node is selected during the migration, the system automatically schedules the Connector to a server that has not experienced any performance bottleneck, but not necessarily with the lowest usage.

* If a node is selected during the migration, the tag and quota of the server can be ignored, but the server must be able to run the Connector.

## Procedure 

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Components**.

   

3. On the **Components** page, click the **Connector** tab.

4. On the **Connector** tab, search for the target Connector by name, synchronization task, or IP address of the server. 

5. Click **Migrate** in the corresponding **Actions** column.

6. (Optional) In the dialog box that appears, select a node to which you want to migrate the Connector.


7. Click **Migrate**.
