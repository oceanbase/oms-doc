# Use tags to manage data synchronization projects

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to manage data synchronization projects by using tags.

## Background

After you create a data synchronization project, you can use tags to manage and filter the project. All tags can be shared. However, the admin user and general users have different privileges on tags:

* The admin user can create, query, modify, delete, and revoke tags.

* A general user can create, query, and revoke tags, and can modify and delete tags that are created by the user.

* A general user can use tags created by the admin user and other general users but can manage only tags created by themselves.

## Limits

* You can add up to four tags to a data synchronization project.

* The total number of tags for all synchronization projects cannot exceed 100.

* The tag name must be unique.

## Go to the Manage Tags dialog box

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.

3. Go to the **Manage Tags** dialog box.

   You can use one of the following methods to go to the Manage Tags dialog box:

     2. Click the Edit Tag icon in the Actions column of the project.

     3. In the **Edit Tag** dialog box, click the field.
