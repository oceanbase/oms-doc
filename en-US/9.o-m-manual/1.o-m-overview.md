# O&M overview

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition is a service that supports data interaction between OceanBase Database and homogeneous or heterogeneous Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). It supports online data migration and real-time synchronization of incremental data.

The O\&M and monitoring module of the OMS Community Edition console is specially designed for on-site O\&M engineers. It provides visualized O\&M operations for troubleshooting in an isolated network.

The O\&M and monitoring module provides the following features:

* Provides visualized O\&M operations.

  You can view the status, TPS, and latency of each migration or synchronization component, and restart or stop the component.
  
* Provides visualized monitoring based on the monitoring dashboard.

  You can monitor the resource usage and status of servers and components such as Store and Connector in real time, helping you identify and rectify data migration or synchronization faults as soon as possible.
  
* Displays operational logs.

  In traditional O\&M scenarios, to troubleshoot a specific task or component, you must log on to the corresponding server and view the operational or error logs. However, OMS Community Edition enables you to view the logs in a specified path in the console, facilitating troubleshooting.
