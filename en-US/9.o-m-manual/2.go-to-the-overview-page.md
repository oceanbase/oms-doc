# Go to the overview page

The overview page in the O\&M monitoring module of the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) console displays the CPU utilization, memory usage, disk usage, and total number of servers, and the status and number of Store, Connector, JDBCWriter, and Checker components.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Overview**.

3. On the **Overview** page, view the number of servers, CPU utilization, memory and disk usage, and the status and number of all components in the region.

   If your business system is deployed in multiple regions, you can click the tab of a region to view its details.

   The **Overview** page displays the status of the components corresponding to all OMS data migration and synchronization tasks in the region. This helps you perform routine O\&M and task monitoring operations. You can view the information about the components in the following sections.

   * **Server**

     The **Server** section displays server resource utilization such as the CPU, memory, and disk usage, and the total number of servers in the current region. The memory and disk usage is displayed in GB.

     You can determine the resource usage of servers in the current region by analyzing the preceding information.

   * **Store**

     The **Store** section displays the total number of store components in the region, and the number of store components that are in the **Running** , **Stopped** , or **Failed** state. To troubleshoot a store component that is in error, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Store** in the left-side navigation pane.

     We recommend that you clear in-error stores as soon as possible. For more information about the store components, see [View store details](../9.o-m-manual/4.components/1.store/2.view-details-of-a-store.md).

   * **Connector**

     The **Connector** section displays the total number of connector components in the region, and the number of connector components that are in the **Running**, **Stopped**, or **Failed** state. To troubleshoot a connector component that is in error, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Connector** in the left-side navigation pane.

     We recommend that you clear in-error connectors as soon as possible. For more information about the connector components, see [View connector details](../9.o-m-manual/4.components/2.connector/1.view-details-of-a-connector.md).

   * **JDBCWriter**

     The **JDBCWriter** section displays the total number of JDBCWriter components in the region, and the number of JDBCWriter components that are in the **Running**, **Stopped**, or **Failed** state. To troubleshoot a JDBCWriter component that is in error, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **JDBCWriter** in the left-side navigation pane. For more information about the JDBCWriter components, see [View JDBCWriter details](../9.o-m-manual/4.components/3.jdbcwriter/1.view-details-of-a-jdbcwriter.md).

   * **Checker**

     The **Checker** section displays the total number of checker components in the region, and the number of checker components that are in the **Running**, **Stopped**, or **Failed** state. To troubleshoot a checker component that is in error, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Checker** in the left-side navigation pane. For more information about the checker components, see [View checker details](../9.o-m-manual/4.components/4.checker/1.view-the-information-about-a-checker.md).
