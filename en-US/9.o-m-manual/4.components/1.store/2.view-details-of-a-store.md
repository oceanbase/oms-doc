# View details of a store

The O\&M and monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to view the basic information about a store, including the name, type, latency, and status. You can determine the running status of a store based on the basic information.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**. The **Store** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** page, view the basic information about the target store.

   You can search for a target store by store name, migration project ID, or topic.

   **Notice**

   Fuzzy query is not supported on the Stores page.

   | Region               | <ul><li> For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Store**, and the region column is not displayed.   <li> For multi-region deployment, you can filter stores by region and view the stores in the target region.  </ul>  |
   | Type                 | The type of the source database.                                 |
   | RPS                  | The number of transactions handled by the server per second. It is used to measure the system throughput.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
   | Latency              | The difference between the time when data is written to the source database and the time when data is written to the destination database.                                                             |
   | Status               | The status of the store. Valid values: **Running**, **Abnormal**, and **Stopped**.                                                                                                                   |
   | Connections          | The number of downstream nodes during data processing of the store.                                                                                                                                     |
   | Fetch Range in Store | Parsing logs generated in the specified time range during incremental data migration are displayed, to help you understand the status and checkpoint of parsing in real time during the incremental data migration.                                                                                                     |
