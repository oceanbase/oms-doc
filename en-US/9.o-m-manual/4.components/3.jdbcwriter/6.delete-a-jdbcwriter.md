# Delete a JDBCWriter

To reduce redundant JDBCWriters, you can delete JDBCWriters that are in the abnormal or stopped state.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.

4. On the **JDBCWriter** page, search for the JDBCWriter that you want to pause by its name or server IP address. You can also perform a fuzzy search by migration project name or ID. The target JDBCWriter must be in the **Abnormal** or **Stopped** state.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **JDBCWriter**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter JDBCWriters by region and delete the specified JDBCWriters from corresponding regions.
