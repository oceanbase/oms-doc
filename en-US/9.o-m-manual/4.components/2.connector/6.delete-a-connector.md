# Delete a connector

To reduce redundant connectors and save resources, you can delete stopped or abnormal connectors.

## Limits

* You cannot delete connectors corresponding to projects in the Running state.

* If an error is reported when a data synchronization project is running, the project and corresponding connectors need to be deleted before a new synchronization project is created.

## Prerequisites

You have stopped the connector. For more information, see [Stop or start a connector](../2.connector/2.start-and-pase-a-connector.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Connector** tab.

4. On the **Connector** page, you can search for the target connector by connector name, IP address, or data synchronization project. The target connector must be in the **Abnormal** or **Stopped** state.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Connector**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter connectors by region and delete connectors in the target region.

5. Click the **More** icon in the **Actions** column of the target connector and choose **Delete**.

6. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and then click **Delete**.
