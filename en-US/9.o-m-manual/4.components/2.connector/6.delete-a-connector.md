# Delete a connector

To reduce redundant connectors and save resources, you can delete stopped connectors.

## Limits

* You can delete only connectors corresponding to projects in the Stopped state.

* You cannot delete connectors corresponding to projects in the Running state.

* If an error is reported when a data synchronization project is running, the project and corresponding connectors need to be deleted before a new synchronization project is created.

## Prerequisites

You have stopped the connector. For more information, see [Stop or start a connector](../2.connector/2.start-and-pause-a-connector.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

3. On the **Components** page, click the **Connector** tab.

4. On the **Connector** page, you can search for the target connector by connector name, IP address, or data synchronization project.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Connector**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter connectors by region and delete connectors in the target region.

5. Click **Delete** in the Actions column of the target connector.

6. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and then click **Delete**.
