# Batch O\&M

This topic describes how to start, pull data from, or delete the connectors of one server or one synchronization task in batches. Batch O\&M enables you to modify the configurations of multiple connectors at a time, improving O\&M efficiency.

## Usage notes

Connectors can be migrated only in high availability scenarios where multiple servers are deployed.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

3. On the **Components** page, click the **Connector** tab.

4. On the **Connector** page, click **Batch O\&M** in the upper-right corner.

5. Select an operation type. The following options are available: **Stop**, **Start**, **Migrate**, **Update**, and **Delete**.

6. Select a dimension for batch O\&M.

   You can perform batch O\&M by server IP address or synchronization task. For multi-region deployment, region information is displayed in the IP address drop-down list.

7. Click **Submit**.
