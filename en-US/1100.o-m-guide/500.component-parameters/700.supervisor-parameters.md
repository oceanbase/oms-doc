# Parameters of the Supervisor component

The Supervisor component has two configuration files:

- **supervisor.json**: parameter configurations in the JSON format. This configuration file supports dynamic loading of changes and includes some important parameters in the `drc.properties` file.

- **drc.properties**: This configuration file has been deprecated and is reserved only for compatibility. Logic will no longer be added to this file, and existing logic in the file will no longer be modified.

## Description

<main id="notice" type='notice'>

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>If a parameter is followed by a field enclosed with parentheses, this parameter replaces the field in the <code>drc.properties</code> file. If the parameter exists in <code>supervisor.json</code> and is not empty, the configuration in the <code>supervisor.json</code> file applies. Otherwise, the configuration in the <code>drc.properties</code> file applies. </p>

| `enableOldCheckAliveJob` | `true` | Specifies whether to enable the component health check reporting job.  |
| `enableHostStatusJob` | `true` | Specifies whether to enable the server status reporting job.  |
| `enableGetRegTaskJob` | `true` | Specifies whether to enable the task for obtaining information about registered components from the Cluster Manager (CM) component.  |
| `forceCheckDir` | `false` | Specifies whether to check whether a local task process belongs to the expected directory when you use the `ps` command to check the process.  |

| `asyncCommandStorageCf` | `async_command` | The name of the column family in RocksDB where asynchronous commands are locally stored.  |
| `asyncCommandStorageTtlSec` | `7 *24* 2600` | The time-to-live (TTL) for asynchronous commands that are locally stored, in seconds.  |
| `asyncCommandStorageMaxSizeMB` | `100` | The maximum size of asynchronous commands that are locally stored, in MB.  |
| `dbcatDatasourceRetry` | `0` | The number of retries for the DBCat data source.  |
| `enableKillOrphan` | `true` | Specifies whether to delete residual processes of the Incr-Sync component.  |
| `leaseTimeSec` | `300` | The lease time for the automatic exit mechanism of the Incr-Sync component, in seconds.  |
| `allocatedPortCacheTtlSec` | `600` | The TTL for the cache allocated to ports, in seconds.  |
| `diskPaths` | `/home/ds/store;/home/ds/run` | The directory to which the data disk is mounted. It is used for collecting disk usage information.  |
| `enableSingleton` | `true` | Specifies whether to enable a single instance for the Supervisor process.  |
| `enableReportMetrics` | `false` | Specifies whether to enable reporting metrics.  |
| `enableStorageMetrics` | `false` | Specifies whether to enable local storage of metrics.  |
| `enableReportCm` | `true` | Specifies whether to proactively report information such as heartbeat information to the CM component.  |
| `samplingMetricsIntervalSe`c | `10` | The metric collection interval, in seconds.  |
| `checkpointSizeLengthLimit` | `48 *1024* 1024` | The maximum size of the checkpoint file, in bytes.  |

| `bindIp`(bind.ip) | None | The IP address used for reporting in the current environment. The IP address of the Docker may be different from that of an external server. When multiple NICs are available, you must specify an IP address as the identifier of the current supervisor.  |
| `enableMetrics`(metrics.enable) | false | Specifies whether to enable metric collection.  |
| `metricType`(metrics.service.impl) | None | Specifies whether to report metrics. If the value is empty, metrics will not be reported. If the value is INFLUXDB, metrics will be reported to InfluxDB.  |
| `metricServerAddr`(metrics.url) | None | The address of the destination to which metrics are reported.  |
| `metricServerUsername`(metrics.user) | None | The username of the destination to which metrics are reported.  |
