The default value is `30`, indicating that links will no longer be obtained when the CPU usage reaches 30%.  If you set this parameter to 0, CPU resource exhaustion prevention is not activated. The priority of the `limitator.datasource.image.ob10freecpu.min` parameter is lower than that of the limitator.datasource.image.ob10freememory.min parameter, where the latter is used to prevent memory resource exhaustion.  This parameter is deactivated when data write suspension has been triggered based on the setting of the `limitator.datasource.image.ob10freememory.min` parameter. This parameter takes effect only when the threshold specified by the limitator.datasource.image.ob10freememory.min parameter is not reached or the database is the source database, for which the limitator.datasource.image.ob10freememory.min parameter does not take effect.                                                 |

Value range: 10 to 100.  This value is the percentage of idle memory space of OceanBase Database that triggers data write suspension. For example, the value 30 indicates that when the percentage of idle memory space is less than 30%, data writes are suspended, and the program keeps waiting until the percentage of idle memory space exceeds 30%.  This parameter takes effect only on an OceanBase database that serves as the destination of a data migration link.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

After OOM prevention is enabled, the system measures and records the actual memory size. This may affect the system performance.  To enable OOM prevention, you must set `useCursorFetch` to true for setFetchSize to take effect.  <ul><li> If a timestamp value 0000-00-00 00:00:00 exists, an error will be reported, because such a value conflicts with OOM prevention.   <li> To use the PS protocol in a MySQL tenant in OceanBase Database, you must set `useServerPrepStmts` to true to avoid invalid FLOAT values. If a timestamp value 0000-00-00 00:00:00 exists, an error will be reported.  </ul>  For the preceding problems, this parameter is used to determine whether to set `useCursorFetch` and `useServerPrepStmts`.
