# Rename databases and tables

This topic describes how to rename databases and tables.

## Scenarios

By default, synchronization objects, such as databases and tables, have the same names in the source and destination. You can rename synchronization objects in the destination to map the database and table names between the source and the destination. The renaming feature applies to multi-table aggregation scenarios and scenarios where the object names in the test and production environments are inconsistent.

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The multi-table aggregation feature is used to synchronize database and table sharding data such as DRDS and OneProxy to the same table in the destination. </p>

## Limits

* You can rename databases and tables only when you synchronize data from an OceanBase database to an AnalyticDB MySQL database or another OceanBase database.

* OMS only allows you to rename objects in the step of selecting synchronization objects when you configure a data synchronization project.

* Do not rename objects after the data synchronization project is started. Otherwise, the data synchronization project may fail.

## Procedure

1. Create a data synchronization project and configure it to the **Select Synchronization Objects** step.

   For more information, see the topic about creating a data synchronization project between the corresponding data sources in the [Data synchronization](../100.data-synchronization-overview.md) chapter.

2. After you select the synchronization objects, move the pointer over the target table object in the **Destination Objects** list on the right side of the **Select Synchronization Scope** section.

3. Click **Rename**.
