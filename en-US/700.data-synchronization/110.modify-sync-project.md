# Change the name of a data synchronization project

This topic describes how to change the name of a data synchronization project when you use OceanBase Migration Service (OMS).

## Limits

* OMS allows you to change the name of a data migration project in the **Not Started**, **Running**, **Paused**, or **Failed** state.

* If you have created a sub-project to modify the synchronization objects during the running of a data synchronization project, you cannot change the project name. For more information about how to modify the synchronization objects, see [View and modify synchronization objects](../1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/200.view-and-modify-objects-to-be-synchronized.md).

* The project name is a unique identifier for a project of a user.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.

3. On the **Synchronization Projects** page, click the **Edit** icon next to the name of the target project.
