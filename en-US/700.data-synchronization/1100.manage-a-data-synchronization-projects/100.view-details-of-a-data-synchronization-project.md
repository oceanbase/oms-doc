# View details of a data synchronization project

After you start a data synchronization project, you can go to its details page to view its basic information, synchronization details, component monitoring, and synchronization objects.

## Access the details page

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.

3. Click the name of the data synchronization project whose details you want to view to go to the details page.

   On the **Data Synchronization** page, you can search for data synchronization projects by tag, status, type, and keyword. The status of a data synchronization project can be:

   * **Not Started**: The data synchronization project has not been started. You can click **Start** in the **Actions** column to start the project.

   * **Running**: The data synchronization project is in progress. You can view the data synchronization plan and current progress on the right.

   * **Modifying**: The synchronization objects of the data synchronization project are being modified.

   * **Integrating**: The data synchronization project is being integrated with the synchronization object modification task.

   * **Paused**: The data synchronization project is manually paused. You can click **Resume** in the **Actions** column to resume the project.

   * **Failed**: The data synchronization project has failed. You can view where the failure occurred on the right. To view the error messages, click the project name to go to the project details page.

   * **Completed**: The data synchronization project is completed and OMS Community Edition has synchronized the specified data to the destination database in the configured synchronization mode.

   * **Releasing**: The data synchronization project is being released. You cannot edit a data synchronization project in this state.

   * **Released**: The data synchronization project is released. After a data synchronization project is released, OMS Community Edition terminates the project.

## View basic information

The **Basic Information** section displays the basic information of the current data synchronization project.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID | The unique ID of the data synchronization project.  |
| Project Type | The types of the source and destination data sources in the data synchronization project.  |
| Synchronization Type | The synchronization type specified when the data synchronization project was created.  |
| Alert Level | The alert level of the data synchronization project. OMS Community Edition supports the following alert levels: **No Protection**, **High Protection**, **Medium Protection**, and **Low Protection**. For more information, see [Alert settings](../../1000.system-management/200.alert-center/300.manage-alert-settings.md).  |
| Created By | The user who created the data synchronization project.  |
| Created At | The time when the data synchronization project was created.  |
| Synchronization Start Timestamp | The synchronization start timestamp specified when the data synchronization project was created.  |
| Connection Details | The information about the connection between the source and destination databases of the data synchronization project.  |

You can perform the following operations:

* View synchronization objects

   Click **View Objects** in the upper-right corner. The synchronization objects of the current data synchronization project are displayed. You can also modify the synchronization objects of a data synchronization project that meets specific requirements. For more information, see [View and modify synchronization objects](../1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/200.view-and-modify-objects-to-be-synchronized.md).

* View the component monitoring metrics

   Click **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner to view the information about the Store and Connector components.

* View parameters

   Click the **More** icon in the upper-right corner and choose **Settings** from the drop-down list. On the page that appears, you can view the configuration parameters specified when the data synchronization project was created.

* Download object settings

   OMS Community Edition allows you to download the configuration information of a data synchronization project and export the information for batch import. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of synchronization objects](../1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-synchronization-objects.md).

## View synchronization details

In the **Synchronization Details** section, you can view information about **Schema Synchronization**, **Incremental Synchronization Log Pull**, **Full Synchronization**, and **Incremental Synchronization**. Schema synchronization creates a topic. After the schema synchronization is completed, you can query the new topic.

The **Incremental Synchronization** section displays the status, latency, and current timestamp of the data synchronization project. Based on this information, you can learn the running status and performance of the data synchronization project.

When you create a data synchronization project, we recommend that you set the alert level and alert frequency to learn about the project running status in time. OMS Community Edition provides low-level protection by default. You can modify the alert level based on your business requirements. For more information, see [Alert settings](../../1000.system-management/200.alert-center/300.manage-alert-settings.md).

* When the incremental synchronization latency exceeds the specified alert threshold, the incremental synchronization status stays at **Running** and the system does not trigger any alerts.

* When the incremental synchronization latency is less than or equal to the specified alert threshold, the incremental synchronization status changes from **Running** to **Monitoring**. After the incremental synchronization status changes to **Monitoring**, it will not change back to **Running** when the latency exceeds the specified alert threshold.

The **Incremental Synchronization Performance** section displays the latency and traffic of incremental data synchronization in real time. You can view changes in synchronization performance by period or in real time.

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|-------|
| Latency | The latency in synchronizing incremental data from the source database to the destination database, in seconds.  |
| Synchronization Traffic | When incremental synchronization starts, the traffic may contain full-phase data traffic information.  |
| Average Write Duration | The average write time during data synchronization.  |
| RPS | The number of rows written to the destination database per second.  |

## View the component monitoring metrics

On the details page of the data synchronization project, click **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner. You can view the information about the Store and Connector components.

* You can view the **Component ID**, **Earliest Pull Timestamp**, **Current Pull Timestamp**, and **Status** of the Store component. You can perform the following operations:

  * Start a component: Click **Start** in the **Actions** column of the component that you want to start. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

  * Destroy a component: If a component is in the **Error** or **Stopped** state, click the **More** icon in the Actions column of the component and choose **Destroy** from the drop-down list. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** to confirm the operation and click **Delete**.

* You can view the **Store ID**, **Current Timestamp**, **Latency**, and **Status** of the **Connector** component. You can perform the following operations:

  * Start a component: Click **Start** in the **Actions** column of the component that you want to start. In the dialog box that appears, specify **Whether to Pull Back** and click **Start**.

  * Pause a component: Click **Pause** in the **Actions** column of the component that you want to pause. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
