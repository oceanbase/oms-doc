# Create a project to synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a Kafka instance

Kafka is a widely used high-performance distributed stream computing platform. OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition supports real-time data synchronization between OceanBase Database Community Edition and a self-managed Kafka instance, extending the message processing capability. Therefore, the data transmission feature is widely applied to business scenarios such as real-time data warehouse building, data query, and report distribution.

OMS Community Edition enables you to synchronize data to message queue products, extending the all-around application of your business in big data fields, such as data aggregation monitoring, streaming data processing, and online/offline analysis. For more information about the data formats for OceanBase Database Community Edition, see [Data formats](../700.data-synchronization/1200.sync-function-introduction/700.data-formats.md).

## Prerequisites

You have created dedicated database users for data synchronization in the source OceanBase database of Community Edition and granted corresponding privileges to the users. For more information, see [Create a database user](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Limitations

* Only physical tables can be synchronized.

* OMS Community Edition supports Kafka 0.9, 1.0, and 2.x.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>

   <h4>Notice</h4>

   <p>If the Kafka version is 0.9, schema synchronization is not supported. </p>

  </main>

* During data synchronization, if you rename a source table to be synchronized and the new name is beyond the synchronization scope, the data of the source table will not be synchronized to the destination Kafka instance.

* The name of a table to be synchronized, as well as the names of columns in the table, must not contain Chinese characters.

* The data source identifiers and user accounts must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition.

* OMS Community Edition supports the synchronization of only objects whose database name, table name, and column name are ASCII-encoded without special characters. The special characters are line breaks and . | " ' ` ( ) = ; / &.

* OMS Community Edition does not support a standby OceanBase database as the source.

## Considerations

* In a data synchronization project where the source is of the OceanBase Database Community Edition type and DDL synchronization is enabled, if a `RENAME` operation is performed on a table in the source, we recommend that you restart the project to avoid data loss during incremental synchronization.

* Consider the following circumstances when the updated row includes a LOB column:

  * If the LOB column is updated, do not use values of the LOB column before the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation.

      LOB columns can be used to store the following types of data: JSON, GIS, XML, UDT, LONGTEXT, and MEDIUMTEXT.

  * If the LOB column is not updated, the values of the LOB column before and after the `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operation are NULL.

* If the clocks between nodes or between the client and the server are out of synchronization, the latency may be inaccurate during incremental synchronization.

   For example, if the clock is earlier than the standard time, the latency can be negative. If the clock is later than the standard time, the latency can be positive.

* When data transfer is resumed for a project, some data (within the last minute) may be duplicated in the Kafka instance, and deduplication is required in downstream systems.

* When you synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a Kafka instance, if the statement for unique index creation fails the execution at the source, the Kafka instance consumes the DDL statements for unique index creation and deletion. If the downstream DDL statement for unique index creation fails the execution, ignore this exception.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>

   <h4>Notice</h4>

   <p>Liboblog 2.2.x does not guarantee the order of DDL or DML statements and may cause data quality issues. </p>

  </main>

## Supported DDL operations

* `CREATE TABLE`

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>

   <h4>Notice</h4>

   <p>The created table must be a synchronization object. To execute the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement on a synchronized table, execute the <code>DROP TABLE</code> statement on this table first. </p>

  </main>

* `ALTER TABLE`

* `DROP TABLE`

* `TRUNCATE TABLE`

   In delayed deletion, the same transaction contains two identical `TRUNCATE TABLE` DDL statements. In this case, idempotence is implemented for downstream consumption.

* `ALTER TABLE…TRUNCATE PARTITION`

* `CREATE INDEX`

* `DROP INDEX`

* `COMMENT ON TABLE`

* `RENAME TABLE`

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>

   <h4>Notice</h4>

   <p>The renamed table must be a synchronization object. </p>

  </main>

## Procedure

1. Create a data synchronization project.

   1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.

   3. On the **Data Synchronization** page, click **Create Synchronization Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Synchronization Project Name | The name of the migration project. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. The name cannot contain spaces or exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Tag (Optional) | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can also click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Manage data synchronization projects by using tags](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-synchronization-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list to create one in the dialog box on the right side. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Destination | If you have created a Kafka data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, click **Add Data Source** in the drop-down list to create one in the dialog box on the right side. For more information, see [Create a Kafka data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/500.create-a-kafka-data-source.md).  |

3. Click **Next**. On the **Select Synchronization Type** page, select the synchronization type for the current data synchronization project.

   Valid values: **Schema Synchronization**, **Full Synchronization**, and **Incremental Synchronization**. **Full Synchronization** supports the synchronization of tables without primary keys. **Incremental Synchronization** supports [DML Synchronization](1200.sync-function-introduction/100.sync-dml.md) and [DDL Synchronization](1200.sync-function-introduction/200.sync-ddl.md).

4. Optional. Click **Next**.

   To synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition, you must specify **OCP** (Optional), **Username**, and **Password** for schema migration and incremental synchronization.

   If you select **Schema Migration** and **Incremental Synchronization** without configuring the required parameters for the source database, the **More About Data Sources** dialog box appears to prompt you to configure the parameters. For more information about the parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

5. Click **Next**. On the **Select Synchronization Objects** page, select a synchronization scope.

   When you synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a Kafka instance, you can synchronize data from multiple tables to multiple topics.

   1. In the left-side pane, select the objects to be synchronized.

   2. Click **>**.

   3. In the **Map Object to Topic** dialog box, select a mapping method.

      If you did not select **Schema Synchronization** when you set the synchronization type, you can select only **Existing Topics** here. If you select **Schema Synchronization** when you set the synchronization type, you can select only one mapping method to create or select a topic.

      For example, if you have selected Schema Synchronization, when you use both the Create Topic and Select Topic mapping methods or rename the topic, a precheck error will be returned due to option conflicts.

      | Parameter | Description |
      |------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Create Topic | Enter the name of the new topic in the text box. The topic name contains 3 to 64 characters, and can contain only letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).  |
      | Select Topic | OMS Community Edition allows you to query Kafka topics. You can click **Select Topic**, and then find and select the topics to be synchronized from the **Existing Topics** drop-down list. You can also enter the name of an existing topic and select it after it appears.  |
      | Batch Generate Topics | The format for generating topics in batches is `Topic_${Database Name}_${Table Name}`.  |

      If you select **Create Topic** or **Batch Generate Topics**, you can query the newly created topics in the Kafka instance after schema synchronization is completed. By default, each Kafka topic has three partitions, and each partition has one replica. The default settings cannot be modified. If the topics do not meet your business needs, you can create topics in the destination database as needed.

   4. Click **OK**.

   When you synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a Kafka instance, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects from text and perform the following operations on the objects in the destination database: change topics, set row filtering conditions, and remove a single object or all objects. Objects in the destination database are listed in the structure of Topic > Database > Table.

   | Operation | Steps |
   |----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Import Objects | <ol><li>In the list on the right, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.   <li> In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.<br>    <li> In the **Import Synchronization Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be synchronized. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of synchronization objects](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-synchronization-objects.md).   <li> Click **Validate**.   <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**.   </ol> |
   | Change Topic | OMS Community Edition allows you to change topics for objects in the destination database. For more information, see [Change topics](1200.sync-function-introduction/400.topic-rename.md).  |
   | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to configure row-based filtering, select sharding columns, and select columns to be synchronized. <ol><li> In the list on the right, move the pointer over the object that you want to set.    <li> Click **Settings**.    <li> In the **Settings** dialog box, you can perform the following operations:  <ul><li> In the **Row Filters** section, specify a standard SQL `WHERE` clause to filter data by row. For more information, see [Use SQL conditions to filter data](1200.sync-function-introduction/500.sync-row-filters.md).    <li> Select the sharding columns that you want to use from the **Sharding Columns** drop-down list. You can select multiple fields as sharding columns. This parameter is optional.  <br>Unless otherwise specified, select the primary keys as sharding columns. If the primary keys are not load-balanced, select load-balanced fields with unique identifiers as sharding columns to avoid potential performance issues. Sharding columns can be used for the following purposes: <ul><li> Load balancing: Threads used for sending messages can be recognized based on the sharding columns if the destination table supports concurrent writes.    <li> Orderliness: OMS Community Edition ensures that messages are received in order if the values of the sharding columns are the same. The orderliness specifies the sequence of executing DML statements for a column. </ul><li> In the **Select Columns** section, select the columns to be synchronized. For more information, see [Column filtering](1200.sync-function-introduction/600.sync-column-filters.md).  </ul>       <li> Click **OK**.   </ol> |
   | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single object or all objects to be migrated to the destination database during data mapping. <ul><li> Remove a single synchronization object <br>In the list on the right of the selection section, move the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**. The synchronization object is removed.    <li> Remove all synchronization objects <br>In the list on the right of the selection section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all synchronization objects.  |

6. Click **Next**. On the **Synchronization Options** page, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | <ul><li> If you select **Full Synchronization** as the synchronization type, the default value of this parameter is the project startup time and cannot be modified.    <li> If you do not select **Full Synchronization** as the synchronization type, set this parameter to a certain point of time, which is the current system time by default. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp.<br>  **Notice**<br>You can select the current time or a point in time earlier than the current time.  This parameter is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp.   </ul> |
   | Serialization Method | The message format for synchronizing data to the destination Kafka instance. Valid values: **Default**, **Canal**, **Dataworks** (V2.0 supported), **SharePlex**, **DefaultExtendColumnType**, **Debezium**, **DebeziumFlatten**, **Maxwell**, and **DebeziumSmt**. For more information, see [Data formats](1200.sync-function-introduction/700.data-formats.md).   <br>**Notice**   <ul><li>Only MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database support the **Debezium**, **DebeziumFlatten**, and **DebeziumSmt** formats.  <li>If the message format is set to **Dataworks**, DDL operations `COMMENT ON TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE…TRUNCATE PARTITION` cannot be synchronized.  |
   | Partitioning Rules | The rule for synchronizing data from an OceanBase database to a Kafka topic. The data transmission feature supports **Hash**, **Table**, and **One**.  <ul><li> **Hash** indicates that OMS Community Edition uses a hash algorithm to select the partition of a Kafka topic based on a hashed value of the value of the primary key or sharding column. <br>**Notice**<br>The Hash rule supports only delivering data to all partitions. <li> **Table** indicates that OMS Community Edition delivers all data in a table to the same partition and uses the table name as the hash key.    <li> **One** indicates that JSON messages are delivered to a partition under a topic to ensure ordering. </ul> |
   | Business System Identification (Optional) | Identifies the source business system of data. The business system identifier consists of 1 to 20 characters.  |

7. Click **Precheck**.

   During the **precheck**, OMS Community Edition detects the connection with the destination Kafka instance. If an error is returned during the precheck:

   * You can identify and troubleshoot the problem and then perform the precheck again.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the Actions column of the failed precheck item. A dialog box appears, prompting you the impact. If you want to skip this operation, click **OK**.

8. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data synchronization project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the synchronization objects during a synchronization project. For more information, see [View and modify synchronization objects](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/200.view-and-modify-objects-to-be-synchronized.md). After a data synchronization project is started, the synchronization objects will be executed based on the selected synchronization type. For more information, see the "View synchronization details" section in the [View details of a data synchronization project](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-synchronization-project.md) topic.

   If the data synchronization project encounters a running exception due to a network failure or slow startup of processes, you can click **Recover** on the Synchronization Projects page or on the Details page of the synchronization project.
