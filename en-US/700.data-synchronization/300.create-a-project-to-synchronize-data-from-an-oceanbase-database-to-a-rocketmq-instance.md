# Create a project to synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a RocketMQ instance

Message Queue for Apache RocketMQ is a distributed message-oriented middleware built by Alibaba Cloud based on Apache RocketMQ. It features low latency, high concurrency, and high reliability. The data synchronization feature of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to synchronize data between a physical table in OceanBase Database Community Edition and a RocketMQ data source in real time, extending the message processing capability.

For more information about the data formats for OceanBase Database Community Edition, see [Data formats](../700.data-synchronization/1200.sync-function-introduction/700.data-formats.md).

## Prerequisites

A topic with the partition-ordered messages property is created in your RocketMQ instance.

## Limits

* Only physical tables can be synchronized.

* During data synchronization, OMS Community Edition allows you to delete a table and then create a new one. In other words, you can first perform the `drop table a` operation and then the `create table a_tmp` operation without affecting the project. OMS Community Edition does not allow you to create a table by renaming an existing table. After you perform the `rename table a to a_tmp` operation, the project cannot be carried out.

* When a data synchronization project is resumed, some data (within the last minute) may be duplicated in the RocketMQ instance, and deduplication is required in downstream applications.

* The name of a table to be synchronized, as well as the names of columns in the table, must not contain Chinese characters.

## Procedure

1. Create a data synchronization project.

   1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Synchronization**.

   3. On the **Data Synchronization** page, click **Create Synchronization Project** in the upper-right corner.

2. On the **Select Source and Destination** page, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Synchronization Project Name | We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 64 characters in length.  |
   | Label | Click the field and select a target tag from the drop-down list. You can click **Manage Tags** to create, modify, and delete tags. For more information, see [Use tags to manage data synchronization projects](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/300.use-tags-to-manage-data-synchronization-projects.md).  |
   | Source | If you have created a physical OceanBase data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, select **Create Data Source** from the drop-down list to add one in the dialog box on the right side. For more information about parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).  |
   | Destination | If you have created a RocketMQ data source, select it from the drop-down list. Otherwise, select **Create Data Source** from the drop-down list to add one in the dialog box on the right side. For more information, see [Create a RocketMQ data source](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/600.create-a-rocketmq-data-source.md).  |

3. Click **Next**. On the **Select Synchronization Type** page, specify Synchronization Type for the current data synchronization project.

   **Synchronization Type** supports only `DML Synchronization` in **Incremental Synchronization**. The DML operations for synchronization are `Insert, Delete`, and `Update`.

4. Optional. Click **Next**.

   To synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition, you must specify **OCP (Optional)**, **Username**, and **Password** for incremental synchronization.

   If you have selected **Incremental Synchronization** without configuring the required parameters for the source database, the **More About Data Sources** dialog box appears to prompt you to configure the parameters. For more information about parameters, see [Create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition](../800.create-and-manage-data-sources/100.create-a-data-source/100.add-an-oceanbase-ce-data-source.md).

   After you configure the parameters, click **Test Connectivity**. After the test succeeds, click **Save**.

5. Click **Next**. On the **Select Synchronization Objects** page, select a synchronization scope.

   When you synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a RocketMQ instance, you can synchronize data from multiple tables to multiple topics.

   1. In the left-side pane, select the objects to be synchronized.

   2. Click **>**.

   3. Click the **Existing Topics** drop-down list in the **Map the Object to the Topic** dialog box and select the target topic.

      You can also enter the name of an existing topic and select it after it appears.

   4. Click **OK**.

      When you synchronize data from OceanBase Database Community Edition to a RocketMQ instance, OMS Community Edition allows you to import objects from text and perform the following operations on the objects in the destination database: change topics, set row filtering conditions, and remove a single object or all objects. Objects in the destination database are listed in the structure of Topic > Database > Table.

      | Operation | Steps |
      |----------|------------------------------------|
      | Import Objects | <ol><li>In the list on the right, click **Import Objects** in the upper-right corner.   <li> In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.  **Notice**<br>This operation will overwrite previous selections. Proceed with caution.<br>    <li> In the **Import Synchronization Objects** dialog box, import the objects to be synchronized. <br>You can import CSV files to rename databases/tables and set row filtering conditions. For more information, see [Download and import the settings of synchronization objects](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/400.download-and-import-the-settings-of-synchronization-objects.md).   <li> Click **Validate**.   <li> After the validation succeeds, click **OK**.   </ol> |
      | Change Topic | <ol><li> In the list on the right, move the pointer over the object that you want to modify.    <li> Click **Change Topic**.    <li> In the **Map Object to Topic** dialog box, change the topics to be synchronized.   <li> Click **OK**.  <br>**Notice**<br>The selected topics and tables will be merged into the selected topic. Proceed with caution.   </ol> |
      | Settings | OMS Community Edition allows you to specify the `WHERE` clause to implement row filters and select sharding columns and columns to synchronize. <ol><li> In the list on the right, move the pointer over the object that you want to modify.    <li> Click **Settings**.    <li> In the **Settings** dialog box, you can perform the following operations:  <ul><li> In the **Row Filters** section, specify a standard SQL `WHERE` clause to filter data by row. The setting takes effect for both **full synchronization** and **incremental synchronization**. <br>Only the data meeting the `WHERE` condition is synchronized to the destination data source, thereby filtering data by row. <br>If the statement contains a reserved SQL keyword, add an escape character (`).    <li> Select the sharding columns that you want to use from the **Sharding Columns** drop-down list. You can select multiple fields as sharding columns. This parameter is optional.  <br>Unless otherwise specified, select the primary keys as sharding columns. If the primary keys are not load-balanced, select fields with unique identifiers and whose load is balanced as sharding columns.  <br>Ensure that the selected sharding columns are correct. An incorrect sharding column will cause data synchronization to fail. Sharding columns can be used for the following purposes: <ul><li> Load balancing: Threads used for sending messages can be recognized based on the sharding columns if the destination table supports concurrent writes.    <li> Orderliness: OMS Community Edition ensures that messages are received in order if the values of the sharding columns are the same. The orderliness specifies the sequence of executing DML statements for a column. </ul></ul>     <li> In the **Select Columns** section, select the columns to be synchronized. If you select all or no columns, OMS Community Edition will synchronize all columns.      <li> Click **OK**.   </ol> |
      | Remove/Remove All | OMS Community Edition allows you to remove a single object or all objects to be migrated to the destination database during data mapping. <ul><li> Remove a single synchronization object <br>In the list on the right of the selection section, hover the pointer over the target object, and click **Remove**. The synchronization object is removed.    <li> Remove all synchronization objects <br>In the list on the right of the selection section, click **Remove All** in the upper-right corner. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK** to remove all synchronization objects.  |

6. Click **Next**. On the **Synchronization Options** page, specify the following parameters.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Incremental Synchronization Start Timestamp | This parameter specifies to synchronize the data after the synchronization start timestamp. The default value is the current system time. You can select a point in time or enter a timestamp.  <br>**Notice**<br>You can select the current time or a point in time earlier than the current time.  This parameter is closely related to the retention period of archived logs. Generally, you can start data synchronization from the current timestamp.  |
   | Serialization Method | The message format for synchronizing data to a RocketMQ instance. Valid values: **Default**, **Canal**, **Dataworks** (version 2.0), **SharePlex**, **DefaultExtendColumnType**, and **Debezium**. For more information, see [Data formats](../700.data-synchronization/1200.sync-function-introduction/700.data-formats.md).  |
   | Enable Intra-Transaction Sequence | Specifies whether to maintain order within a transaction. If this feature is enabled, OMS Community Edition marks the sequence number for a transaction to be sent to a downstream node.<br>  **Notice**<br>This parameter is valid only for the **SharePlex** format and is intended for you to obtain the sequence numbers of the DML statements that form a transaction.  <br>For example, if a transaction contains 10 DML statements numbered from 1 to 10, OMS Community Edition will deliver these statements to the destination database in the same order. <br>If this option is enabled, the system performance may be affected. Choose whether to enable it based on the business characteristics.  |
   | Partitioning Rules | When you synchronize data to a RocketMQ instance, only **Hash** is supported.  <br>**Hash** indicates that OMS Community Edition uses a hash algorithm to select the message queue (MQ) for RocketMQ based on a hashed value of the value of the primary key or sharding column.  |
   | Business System Identification (Optional) | Identifies the source business system of data. The business system identifier consists of 1 to 20 characters.  |
   | Enter the name of the producer group | This parameter specifies a producer group that can write data into multiple topics.  |
   | Whether to Allow Message Tracing | This parameter specifies whether to allow message tracing. If message tracing is enabled, you can trace the complete project information, including node time and status, of a message in its entire lifecycle from transmission by the producer to the RocketMQ server, to consumption by consumers. The message tracing feature provides data support for troubleshooting in the production environment.  |

7. Click **Precheck**.

   During the precheck, OMS Community Edition detects the connection with the destination data source. If the project failed the precheck:

   * You can identify the cause, fix the problem, and run the precheck again until it succeeds.

   * You can also click **Skip** in the **Actions** column of the failed precheck item. A dialog box appears, prompting you the impact. If you want to skip this operation, click **OK**.

8. Click **Start Project**. If you do not need to start the project now, click **Save** to go to the details page of the data synchronization project. You can start the project later as needed.

   OMS Community Edition allows you to modify the synchronization objects during a synchronization project. For more information, see [View and modify synchronization objects](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/200.view-and-modify-objects-to-be-synchronized.md). After a data synchronization project is started, the synchronization objects will be executed based on the selected synchronization type. For more information, see the "View synchronization details" section in the [View details of a data synchronization project](1100.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/100.view-details-of-a-data-synchronization-project.md) topic.

   If data access fails due to a network failure or the slow startup of processes, go to the project list or the project details page and click **Restore**.
