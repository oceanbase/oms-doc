Start and pause a checker 
==============================================

The O\&M monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to start and pause a checker. You can pause a checker for troubleshooting, and start it again after the problem is fixed.

If you want to run a checker in the **Stopped** or **Abnormal** state, manually start it.

3. On the **Components** page, click the **Checker** tab.

   

4. On the **Checker** page, search for the target checker by checker name, migration project name, or server IP address. 

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Checker** .

     
   
   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter checkers by region and start the checkers that are not running in the target region.
