View details of a store 
============================================

The O\&M and monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to view the basic information about a store, including the name, type, latency, and status. You can determine the running status of a store based on the basic information. 

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OMS console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components** . The **Store** page automatically appears.

   

3. On the **Store** page, view the basic information about the target store. 

   You can search for a target store by store name, migration project ID, or topic. 
   **Notice**

   

   Fuzzy query is not supported on the Stores page.
