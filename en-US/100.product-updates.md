## Support for migration from HBase to OBKV

* OMS Community Edition supports data migration from HBase 1.2.0-cdh5.15.2.

* A project that migrates data from an HBase database to OBKV supports only schema migration, full migration, and incremental synchronization. Full verification and reverse incremental migration are not supported.

* OMS Community Edition supports full migration and incremental synchronization tasks in Flink clusters of version 1.14.0.

* The computing platform management feature is provided for you to add Flink clusters.

## Support for OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.2.1

* This version fully supports OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.2.1. You can use OMS for data migration or synchronization from or to OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.2.1.

## More user-friendly

* Migration options

   In a project that migrates data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition, OMS Community Edition provides default mappings that you can select and edit based on the character sets supported by the destination database. You can also modify parameters related to full migration and incremental synchronization when you create a project. This way, you do not need to pause the project during project running and then modify related parameters like in previous versions.

* OMS deployment

   Databases in the sys tenant cannot be used as MetaDBs.

* Prompt optimization

  * When you create a data source of OceanBase Database Community Edition, you are prompted that OMS Community Edition must connect to the data source by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP).

  * When you choose **System Management** > **Associated OCP Clusters** to add an associated OCP Cluster, tooltip prompts are provided for the **Username** and **Password** fields.
