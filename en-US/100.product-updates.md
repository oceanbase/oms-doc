* OMS Community Edition supports data migration from MySQL databases to OceanBase Database Community Edition in active-active disaster recovery scenarios.

* The configuration of a data migration project for active-active disaster recovery is optimized. To create a migration project in an active-active disaster recovery scenario, you need to only select **Active-Active Disaster Recovery** for **Scenarios** instead of creating two links.
