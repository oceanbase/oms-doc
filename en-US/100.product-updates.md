# What's new

This topic describes the features of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition V4.0.0-CE.

## Rich data migration and synchronization features

* OceanBase Database Community Edition V4.0.0-CE is supported. For information, see [Migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Community Edition](6.data-migration/2.create-a-project-to-migrate-data-from-a-mysql-database-to-a-mysql-tenant-of-oceanbase-database.md)

* Migrating and synchronizing data tables without unique keys from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition are supported.

* Automatically creating a database that does not exist in the destination database is supported when you migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* Adding and removing tables are supported to make the O&M of the product easier. For information, see [View and modify migration objects](6.data-migration/15.manage-data-migration-projects/2.view-and-modify-migration-objects.md) and [View and modify synchronization objects](7.data-synchronization/11.manage-a-data-synchronization-projects/2.view-and-modify-objects-to-be-synchronized.md).

* Monitoring the execution time of SQL statements in the full migration step is supported to help you effectively identify performance-related issues.

* Monitoring the execution time of SQL statements and the statistics of incremental data in the incremental synchronization and reverse incremental migration steps is supported to show the project performance and track changed objects.

* Importing partitioned tables into an database of OceanBase Database Community Edition by partition is supported. This improves the full migration performance in an all-around manner and reduces the overall migration time.

## Feature upgrades

* The verification code mechanism is provided to improve security.

* You can skip the precheck and forward switchover steps. This ensures a smooth process when an exception occurs.

* You can skip unsupported DDL statements with one click. This simplifies user operations and improves product usability.

* The Debezium JSON message format is supported. For information, see [Data formats](7.data-synchronization/16.data-formats.md).

* Automatically clearing virtual columns that are manually created in the forward switchover step is supported. This simplifies subsequent operations. For information, see [Schema migration mechanisms](6.data-migration/16.schema-migration-for-tables-without-a-primary-key.md).

* The project monitoring and alerting logic is optimized to ensure that projects can be monitored in special scenarios.

* Table processing failures that occur in the schema migration, full migration, or full verification step do not affect the migration project.

* You can enable force character set conversion when the character set of the source or destination database is not supported.

* A three-layer permission model consisting of the ROOT, ADMIN, and USER roles and roles with read-only permissions is supported. You can manage permissions by department. For information, see [Overview](10.system-management/1.permission-management/1.permission-overview.md).
