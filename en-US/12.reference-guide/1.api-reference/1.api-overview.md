# Overview

This topic lists the API operations provided by OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) and the access URLs and authentication of these operations.

## API operations

You can call the following operations to access related OMS features and perform corresponding operations:

* [Obtain the status of a migration project](../1.api-reference/2.obtain-the-status-of-a-migration-project.md)

* [Obtain the status of a synchronization project](../1.api-reference/3.obtain-the-status-synchronization-project.md)

## Access URL

After OMS deployment is completed, you can access the OMS APIs at `http://ip_address:8089/`. In the URL, the IP address is the same as the access URL of the web console of OMS.

## API authentication

When you call the API operation to create a project for synchronizing data from an OceanBase database to a Kafka instance, your role must be verified. You need to add `-H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=` to the request. You can obtain content after Basic by converting the username and password of your OMS account Sample code:

* Generate the content by using code.

  ```unknow
  byte[] b= new byte[0];
  try {
   b = (omsUser + ":" + omsPassword).getBytes("utf-8");
   } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    }
  String basicString = new BASE64Encoder().encode(b);
  Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<>();
  headers.put("Authorization", "Basic " + basicString);
  ```
