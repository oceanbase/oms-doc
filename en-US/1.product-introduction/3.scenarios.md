# Scenarios

This topic describes the enterprise-class data migration and synchronization scenarios of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## In-service data migration

In traditional database migration solutions, data is usually migrated during downtime to ensure the migration stability and data consistency. During the downtime, data writes to the source database must be temporarily stopped. The business database can be switched only after the migration is completed and the data consistency is verified.

The downtime duration varies according to the business data volume and network conditions. In case of a massive volume of business data, the downtime may last several days, greatly affecting the business.

OMS Community Edition supports in-service data migration, ensuring service continuity of the source database during the migration and minimizing the impact of data migration on the business. During schema migration, full data migration, and incremental data migration, the full data and incremental data in the source database are synchronized to the destination database in real time. After the data verification succeeds, the business can be handed over from the source database to the destination database.

## Real-time data synchronization

OMS Community Edition can synchronize incremental data from OceanBase Database to message queues such as Kafka and RocketMQ in real time, which improves the message processing capability and extends the business application in monitoring data aggregation, streaming data processing, online/offline analysis, and other big data fields.

OMS Community Edition enables real-time data synchronization between physical tables of OceanBase Database and data sources such as Kafka. It is recommended that you use OMS Community Edition in cloud BI, real-time data warehouse construction, data querying, report distribution, and other business scenarios.
