![Hierarchical architecture](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/3074229461/p292961.png)

* Service access layer

  The service access layer manages migration projects and various data sources, and implements the O\&M, monitoring, and alerts of all OMS Community Edition components.
  
* Process orchestration layer

  The process orchestration layer manages the details for performing tasks such as upper-layer schema migration, full data migration or synchronization, incremental data migration or synchronization, data verification, data correction, and link switching.

* Component link layer

  The component link layer contains the following components:
  * DBCat: accurately maps or converts data based on the source data type, destination data type, and character encoding type. The DBCat component is the native schema conversion engine of OceanBase Database and is the core schema migration component of OMS Community Edition.

    The DBCat component can convert and migrate various database objects such as tables, constraints, indexes, and views.
  
  * Checker: migrates and verifies full data, and generates correction SQL scripts for inconsistent data.

  * Store: reads, parses, and stores incremental logs of the database.

  * JDBCWriter: concurrently writes data to the destination database.
  
  * Connector: incrementally writes data to the destination message queue.
  
  * Supervisor: monitors the component status.
