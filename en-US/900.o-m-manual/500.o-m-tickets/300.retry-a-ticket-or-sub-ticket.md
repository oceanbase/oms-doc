# Retry a task or subtask

If an O&M task fails, you can retry the failed steps. This operation applies to an O&M task or its subtasks.

## Limitations

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to retry a task in the **Failed** state.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **O&M Tasks**.

3. Search for a specific O&M task by operation type, creation time, operation object, or operator.

4. Click the ID of the O&M task to go to the task details page.

5. Retry the task or one of its subtasks.

   * Retry the task: Click **Retry** in the upper-right corner of the Tasks tab.

   * Retry a subtask: Click **Retry** in the Actions column corresponding to the subtask.

6. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
