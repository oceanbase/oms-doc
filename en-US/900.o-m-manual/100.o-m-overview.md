# O&M overview

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition is a service that supports data interaction between OceanBase Database and homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources. It supports online data migration and real-time synchronization of incremental data.

The OPS & Monitoring module of the OMS Community Edition console is specially designed for on-site O&M engineers. It allows visualized O&M operations for troubleshooting in an isolated network.

The OPS & Monitoring module provides the following features:

* Provides a GUI for O&M operations.

   Allows you to view the status, RPS, and latency of each migration or synchronization component, and start or pause the component on the GUI.

* Provides GUI-based monitoring features, such as the monitoring dashboard.

   Displays the overall information such as the resource usage and running status of the servers, Store, Full-Verification, Full-Import, and Incr-Sync components in real time. In this way, you can promptly notice and troubleshoot data migration or synchronization issues.

* Displays operational logs on the GUI.

   In conventional O&M scenarios, to troubleshoot a specific project or component, you must log on to the corresponding server and view the operational or error logs. However, OMS Community Edition allows you to view the logs in a specified path in the console, facilitating troubleshooting.
