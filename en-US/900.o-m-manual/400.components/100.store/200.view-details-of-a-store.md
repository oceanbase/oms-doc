# View details of a store

The OPS & Monitoring module of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to view the basic information about a store, including the name, type, latency, and status. You can determine the running status of a store based on the basic information.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** **>** **Component**. The **Store** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** tab, view the basic information about the target store.

   You can search for a target store by store name, topic, subtopic, or project ID.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Fuzzy query is not supported on the Store tab. </p>
    </main>

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Name | The name of the store.  |
   | Region | <ul><li>For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Store**, and the region column is not displayed.    <li> For multi-region deployment, you can filter stores by region and view the stores in the target region. </ul> |
   | Type | The type of the source database.  |
   | RPS | The number of transactions handled by the server per second. It is used to measure the system throughput.  |
   | Latency | The difference between the time when data is written to the source database and the time when data is written to the destination database.  |
   | Status | The status of the store. Valid values: **Running**, **Abnormal**, and **Stopped**.  |
   | Start Timestamp | The earliest event time of all LogRecords in the current store. The store saves a series of LogRecords (transaction log records) and each LogRecord corresponds to an event time, which indicates the time when this record is changed in the database or the time when the corresponding transaction is committed.   |
   | Current Timestamp | The latest event time of all LogRecords in the current store.  |
   | Connections | The number of downstream nodes during data processing of the store.  |
   | Actions | <ul><li>You can perform the following operations on a store in the **Running** state: **Pause**, **Update**, and **View Logs**. <li>You can perform the following operations on a store in the **Stopped**, **Abnormal**, or **Unexpected Exit** state: **Start**, **Update**, **Delete**, and **View Logs**. </ul> |

4. You can click **View Logs** in the Actions column of the target store to view the logs of the store. You can also download and copy the logs.
