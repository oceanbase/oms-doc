# Start and pause a store

If the store corresponding to a data synchronization task fails, you can pause the store for troubleshooting and then restart the store. You can also stop and restart the store when an operational error occurs.

## Start a store

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**. The **Store** page automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** page, click **Start** on the right of the target store, which must be in the **Abnormal** or **Stopped** state.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Store**.

   * For multi-region deployment, you can filter stores by region and start the stores that are not running in the target region.

4. In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
