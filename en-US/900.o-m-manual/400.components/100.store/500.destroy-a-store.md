# Delete a store

This topic describes how to delete a store to save running resources.

## Limits

* OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) allows you to delete a store in the **Stopped**, **Abnormal**, or **Unexpected Exit** state.

* After a store is deleted, it will be permanently deleted from the server and cannot be recovered. Proceed with caution.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** **>** **Component**. The **Store** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Stores** page, click **Delete** on the right of the target store, which must be in the **Abnormal** or **Stopped** state.

   You can filter stores by region and delete the stores that are abnormal or stopped in the target region.

4. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and click **OK**.
