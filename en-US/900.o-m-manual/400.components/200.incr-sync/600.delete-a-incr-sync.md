# Delete an Incr-Sync component

This topic describes how to delete an Incr-Sync component to save running resources.

## Limits

* OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition allows you to delete an Incr-Sync component in the **Stopped** or **Abnormal** state.

* You cannot delete Incr-Sync components corresponding to projects in the Running state.

* If an error is returned when a data migration or synchronization project is running, the project and corresponding Incr-Sync components need to be deleted before a new project is created.

## Prerequisites

The Incr-Sync component to be deleted is stopped. For more information, see [Start and pause an Incr-Sync component](../200.incr-sync/200.start-and-pause-a-incr-sync.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Incr-Sync** tab.

4. On the **Incr-Sync** page, you can search for an Incr-Sync component by component name, server IP address, or project name.

   You can filter Incr-Sync components by region and delete the Incr-Sync components in the target region.

5. Click **More** in the **Actions** column of the target Incr-Sync component and select **Delete** from the drop-down list.

6. In the dialog box that appears, enter **delete** and click **OK**.
