# Batch O&M

To perform common O&M operations such as start and delete operations on the Incr-Sync components of a server or a specific project, you can run batch O&M tasks. Batch O&M allows you to modify the configurations of multiple Incr-Sync components at a time, improving O&M efficiency.

## Usage notes

You can perform batch O&M for Incr-Sync components only when multiple servers are available in a high availability scenario.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** > **Component**.

3. On the **Component** page, click the **Incr-Sync** tab.

4. On the **Incr-Sync** page, click **Batch O&M** in the upper-right corner.

5. Select an operation type. The following options are available: **Stop**, **Start**, **Migrate**, **Update**, and **Delete**.

6. Select a dimension for batch O&M.

   You can perform batch O&M by server IP address or project name. For multi-region deployment, region information is displayed in the IP address drop-down list.

7. Click **Submit**.
