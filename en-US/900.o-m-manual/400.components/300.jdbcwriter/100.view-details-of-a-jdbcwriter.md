# View details of a JDBCWriter

JDBCWriter is a component of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition that writes incremental data to the destination database during incremental data migration. The JDBCWriters page of the OMS Community Edition monitoring module provides common JDBCWriter O\&M operations. You can also view the basic information about the JDBCWriter on it.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** **\>** **Components**.

3. On the **Components** page, click the **JDBCWriter** tab.

4. On the **JDBCWriter** page, search for the target JDBCWriter by its name or server IP address. You can also perform a fuzzy search by migration project name or ID.

5. View the basic information about the target JDBCWriter.

   |-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Name              | The name of the JDBCWriter.  Hover the pointer over the name of the JDBCWriter and click the copy icon to copy the name of JDBCWriter.                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Region            | <ul><li> For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **JDBCWriter**.   <li> For multi-region deployment, you can filter JDBCWriters by region and view the JDBCWriters in the target region. </ul>   |
   | Migration Project | The name of the data migration project. You can click the name to go to the details page of the data migration project.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | Type              | The type of the data migration project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | Latency (s)       | The difference between the latest point in time when incremental data is written to the destination database and the current standard time. You can determine the running status of the project based on this value.                                                                                            |
   | Status            | The status of the JDBCWriter. Valid values: **Running**, **Stopped**, **Abnormal**, and **Completed**.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   | Actions           | For a running JDBCWriter, the following options are provided: **Pause**, **Update**, and **View Logs**.  For a stopped or abnormal JDBCWriter, the following options are provided: **Start**, **Update**, **Migrate**, **View Logs**, and **Delete**.                                   |
