# View server information

The OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition console allows you to view the resource usage of servers by region.

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **O\&M and Monitoring** \> **Server**.

   On the **Servers** page of the target region, you can perform O\&M operations on a target server, such as viewing various information of the server, updating the server, and viewing its logs. You can enter an IP address in the search box in the upper-right corner to search for the target server.
