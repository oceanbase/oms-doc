# Create an HBase data source

Before you create a data migration or synchronization project, you must configure the data sources. This topic describes how to create an HBase data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

You have obtained the values of the following parameters required for creating an HBase data source.

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------|--------------------|
| hbase.zookeeper.quorum | The connection address of ZooKeeper. |
| fs.default.name | The Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) for HBase. |
| zookeeper.znode.parent | The path to HBase ZooKeeper files. |
| hbase.rootdir | The root directory of the HBase HDFS. |

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Source Management** page, click **Create Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Create Data Source** dialog box, specify **HBase** for **Data Source Type**.

5. Configure the following parameters.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Source Identifier | The identifier of the data source. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 32 characters in length.  <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The data source identifier must be globally unique in the system of OMS Community Edition. </p></main> |
   | Region | Select the region where the data source resides from the drop-down list. The region is the value that you set for the `cm_region` parameter when you deploy OMS Community Edition. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><ul><li> This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available.    <li>Make sure that the mappings between the data source and the region are consistent. Otherwise, the migration and synchronization performance can be poor.     </ul> </main> |
   | Database Attributes | By default, the required database parameters are displayed. For more information, see the parameter description in the Prerequisites section. You can click **Add** to add and configure other parameters as needed.  |
   | Config File (Optional) | The configuration file of the source HBase cluster, which is named `hbase-site.xml` and located in the /lib/hbase/conf directory.  |
   | Remarks (Optional) | Additional information about the data source.  |

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the network connection between OMS Community Edition and the data source.

7. After the test is passed, click **OK**.
