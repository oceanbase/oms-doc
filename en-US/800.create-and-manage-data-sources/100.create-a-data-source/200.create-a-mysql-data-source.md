# Create a MySQL data source

You must configure data sources before you create a data migration project. Before you start a data migration task, you must add a MySQL database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to create a MySQL data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.

* You have created a database user for data migration.

   We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for the data migration project and grant the required data operation privileges to the user.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Source Management** page, click **Create Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Create Data Source** dialog box, select **MySQL** for **Data Source Type**.

5. Specify the following parameters.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Source Identifier | We recommend that you set it to a combination of Chinese characters, digits, and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 32 characters in length.  |
   | Region | Select the region where the data source resides from the drop-down list. The region is the value that you set for the `cm_region` parameter when you deploy OMS Community Edition.<br>  **Notice**  <ul><li> This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available.    <li>Make sure that the mappings between the data source and the region are consistent. Otherwise, the migration and synchronization performance can be poor.     </ul> |
   | Database Attributes | Database attributes include **Primary Database**, **Primary Database + Standby Database**, and **Standby Database**. When you configure the primary database, you can choose whether to select the following option: **Allow OMS to automatically write heartbeat data into this instance during incremental synchronization. This resolves the problem of high latency when no business data is written in the source database**.  <ul><li> If you select this option, OMS Community Edition creates the `drc.heartbeat` table in the MySQL database and updates the table to store the synchronization timestamps. This prevents OMS Community Edition from displaying lengthy latency information when the source database is not processing business traffic.<br>  **Notice** <br>The MySQL database user must have the privileges to create and write tables. For more information, see [User privileges](../400.user-privileges.md).    <li> If you do not select this option, OMS Community Edition does not create the `drc.heartbeat` table.  |
   | Host IP Address | The IP address of the host where the database is located. You must specify the IP address of the physical server that hosts the Relational Database Service (RDS). Do not enter the IP address of any middleware.  |
   | Port | The port number of the host where the database is located.  |
   | Username | The name of the MySQL database user for data migration or synchronization.  |
   | Password | The password of the database user.  |
   | Database Name | Optional. The name of the MySQL database.  |
   | Remarks | Optional. The additional information about the data source.  |

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the network connection between OMS Community Edition and the data source, as well as the validity of the username and password. You can specify a database as the source or destination.

7. After the connection test succeeds, click **OK**.
