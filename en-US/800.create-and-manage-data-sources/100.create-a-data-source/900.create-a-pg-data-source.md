# Create a PostgreSQL data source

Before you create a data migration or synchronization project, you must configure the data sources. This topic describes how to create a PostgreSQL data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.

* You have created a database user for data migration.

   We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for the data migration project and grant the required data operation privileges to the user. For more information, see [Create a database user](../300.create-a-database-user.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to the console of OMS Community Edition.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Source Management** page, click **Create Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **Create Data Source** dialog box, select **PostgreSQL** for **Data Source Type**.

5. Configure the following parameters.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Source Identifier | The name of the migration project. We recommend that you set it to a combination of digits and letters. It must not contain any spaces and cannot exceed 32 characters in length.  <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The data source identifier must be globally unique in OMS Community Edition. </p></main> |
   | Region | Select the region where the data source resides from the drop-down list. The region is the value that you set for the `cm_region` parameter when you deploy OMS Community Edition. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><ul><li> This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available.    <li>Make sure that the mappings between the data source and the region are consistent. Otherwise, the migration and synchronization performance can be poor.     </ul> </main> |
   | Database Attributes | Database attributes include **Primary Database**, **Primary Database + Standby Database**, **Standby Database**, and **Child Node** (indicating that a data source is directly connected to a segment node of a Greenplum database). When you configure the primary database, you can choose whether to select the following option: **Allow OMS to automatically write incremental heartbeat data to the instance during incremental synchronization**. This resolves the problem of high latency when no business data is written in the source database.  <ul><li> If you select this option, OMS Community Edition creates the `oms_postgres_heartbeat` table in the PostgreSQL database and updates the table to store the synchronization timestamps. This prevents OMS Community Edition from displaying lengthy latency information when the source database is not processing business traffic.<br>  **Notice** <br>The user of the PostgreSQL database must have the privileges to create and write tables. For more information, see [Create and update a heartbeat table](../../600.data-migration/1600.migration-function-introduction/700.create-heartbeat.md).    <li> If you do not select this option, OMS Community Edition does not create the `oms_postgres_heartbeat` table. </ul> |
   | Host IP Address | The IP address of the host where the database is located.  |
   | Port | The port number of the host where the database is located.  |
   | Username | The name of the PostgreSQL database user for data migration or synchronization.  |
   | Password | The password of the database user.  |
   | DB Name | The name of the PostgreSQL database.  |
   | Schema Name (Optional) | The schema name of the PostgreSQL database. This parameter is optional. <br>If you do not specify this parameter, all schemas on which you have the read privilege can be migrated.  |
   | Remarks (Optional) | Additional information about the data source.  |

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the network connection between OMS Community Edition and the data source, as well as the validity of the username and password.

7. After the test is passed, click **OK**.
