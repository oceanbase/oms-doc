# Create a TiDB data source

A data source must be configured before you create a data migration project. To migrate data from or to a TiDB database, you must create the TiDB database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to create a TiDB database as a data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

* You have obtained the IP address and port number of the related database.

* You have created a database user for data migration.

  We recommend that you create a dedicated database user for the data migration project and grant the required data operation privileges to the user. For more information, see [Create and authorize a database user](../3.create-a-database-user.md).
  
* If you need to subscribe to incremental logs from the TiDB database, deploy a Kafka data source and a Kafka topic. In addition, you must create a link between the TiDB database and the Kafka data source in advance.

  **Notice**

  The names of the databases and tables that you subscribe to in the TiDB database must be the same as those specified in the OMS Community Edition console for the data migration project.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OMS Community Edition console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management**.

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **New Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

4. In the **New Data Source** panel, select **TiDB** for **Data Source Type**.

5. Set the following parameters.

   |      **Parameter**       |   **Description**                                                              |
   |--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Source Identifier   | The name of the data source.  The name must be 1 to 32 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and case-sensitive letters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   | Region                   | Select the region where the data source resides from the drop-down list. The region is the value you set for the `cm_region` parameter when you deploy OMS Community Edition. <br> **Notice:**  <ul><li> This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available.   <li> Make sure that the regions specified for the data source and configured in OMS Community Edition are the same. Otherwise, the migration and synchronization performance may be poor.   </ul>    |
   | Host IP Address          | The IP address of the server where the TiDB database is deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   | Port                     | The port number corresponding to the IP address of the server where the TiDB database is deployed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the network connection between OMS Community Edition and the data source, and the validity of the username and password.

7. After the connection test succeeds, click **OK**.
