# （Optional）Deploy a time series database

If you need OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition to collect and display historical monitoring data, deploy a time series database. This topic describes how to deploy a time series database and the restrictions.

## Restrictions

* Currently, InfluxDB 1.8 is deployed as a time series database.

* You need to use port 8086 to deploy a time series database.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the host where the time series database is to be deployed.

2. Load the image of InfluxDB 1.8.

    [Click here](https://oms-images.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/current_branchs/influxdb_1.8.tar.gz) to download the InfluxDB image, and upload it to the host where the time series database is to be deployed.

   ```shell
   sudo docker load -i ${INFLUXDB_IMAGE}
   ```

3. Start the Docker container and ensure that data can be written to the mounted data disk.

   ```shell
   sudo docker run -d -p 8086:8086 \
   -v {Mounted data disk}:/var/lib/influxdb \
   --name=oms-influxdb \
   influxdb:1.8
   ```

4. To enable authentication for the InfluxDB service, create an account and set the password.

   1. Access the InfluxDB container.

      ```shell
      docker exec -it ${INFLUXDB_NAME} bash
      ```

   2. Access the InfluxDB console.

      ```shell
      cd /usr/bin
      ./influx
      ```

   3. Create an account, set the password, and grant the admin privileges to the account.

      ```shell
      create user '${USER_NAME}' with password '${PASSWORD}' with all privileges
      ```

      >**Notice**
      >
      >Save the account and password for configuration of the `config.yaml` file.  

   4. View users.

      ```shell
      show users;
      ```

5. Exit the container where the time series database resides.
