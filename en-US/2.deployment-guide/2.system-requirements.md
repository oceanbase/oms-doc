# System requirements

This topic describes the system requirements for deploying OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition.

## OS

OMS Community Edition can be deployed only on Linux-based servers.

## Ports

The following table describes the ports required for deploying OMS Community Edition on a server. Before deploying, make sure that these ports are unoccupied and the port strategies are enabled.

* The host where OMS Community Edition is to be deployed must provide the following ports.

  |                                                  Port                                                  |                                                   Description                                                    |

  | 8084                                                                                                   | The port used to access the web page of supervisorctl.                                                           |
  | 8088                                                                                                   | The port used to connect to the OMS cluster management (CM) module, whose name is `oms_drc_cm` in supervisorctl. |
  | 9000/9001                                                                                              | The ports for the agent process of the host.                                                                     |
  | 16000 - 16499<br> 17000 - 17499<br> 18000 - 18499 <br> 7100 - 7499 | The ports that are randomly allocated to OMS Community Edition components.                                                         |

* If InfluxDB is deployed, make sure that port 8086 is available for InfluxDB on the host where InfluxDB is deployed.

## NTP service

Before you deploy OMS Community Edition, make sure that the NTP service is provided and enabled on the OMS Community Edition MetaDB and all OMS Community Edition hosts, clocks of hosts are synchronized, and the database time zone and host time zone are consistent.

## Network connectivity

Make sure that the OMS Community Edition hosts are connected to OBProxies, OBServers, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), and data sources involved in migration or synchronization.
