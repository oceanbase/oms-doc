# System requirements

This topic describes the system requirements for deploying OceanBase Migration Service (OMS).

## OS

OMS can be deployed only on Linux-based servers.

## Ports

The following table describes the ports required for deploying OMS on a server. Before deploying, make sure that these ports are unoccupied and the port strategies are enabled.

* The host where OMS is to be deployed must provide the following ports.

  |                                                  Port                                                  |                                                   Description                                                    |

  | 2023                                                                                                   | The SSHD service port.                                                                                           |
  | 8084                                                                                                   | The port used to access the web page of supervisorctl.                                                           |
  | 8088                                                                                                   | The port used to connect to the OMS cluster management (CM) module, whose name is `oms_drc_cm` in supervisorctl. |
  | 9000/9001                                                                                              | The ports for the agent process of the host.                                                                     |
  | 16000 - 16499<br> 17000 - 17499<br> 18000 - 18499 <br> 7100 - 7499 | The ports that are randomly allocated to OMS components.                                                         |

* If InfluxDB is deployed, make sure that port 8086 is available for InfluxDB on the host where InfluxDB is deployed.

## NTP service

Before you deploy OMS, make sure that the NTP service is provided and enabled on the OMS MetaDB and all OMS hosts, clocks of hosts are synchronized, and the database time zone and host time zone are consistent.

## Network connectivity

Make sure that the OMS hosts are connected to OBProxies, OBServers, OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), and data sources involved in migration or synchronization.
