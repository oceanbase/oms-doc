# Prepare the environment

This topic describes the preparations for deploying OceanBase Migration Service (OMS).

## Procedure

1. Install Docker.

   You need to install Docker V1.13 or later on the server where OMS is to be deployed.

2. Prepare a database to store the OMS metadata.

   A database instance is required to persist the OMS metadata. This database can be a MySQL database or OceanBase database. We recommend that you use an OceanBase database.

   Create a MySQL tenant in compatibility mode with 2 CPU cores and 4-GB memory in an OceanBase cluster. Record the connection information of the tenant for later use when you deploy OMS.
