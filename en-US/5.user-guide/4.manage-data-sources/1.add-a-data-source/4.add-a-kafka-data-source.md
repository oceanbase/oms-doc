Add a Kafka data source 
============================================

You must configure data sources before you create a data migration project. To migrate data to a Kafka instance, you must add the Kafka instance as the destination data source. This topic describes how to add a Kafka data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS). 

Limits 
---------------------------

OMS allows you to add a Kafka data source only as the destination for data synchronization.

Prerequisites 
----------------------------------

You have obtained the endpoint of the self-managed Kafka instance.

Background information 
-------------------------------------------

The data security must be ensured across the process of service connectivity verification, link creation, and data transmission. To meet most security requirements, OMS supports data encryption and user authentication based on the Kafka security service. 

OMS supports the following Kafka authentication methods:

* GSS-API

  GSS-API is short for Generic Security Services Application Program Interface. It is a framework that provides general security services to callers, and supports the Kerberos protocol.
  

* PLAIN

  PLAIN authentication is simple, but does not allow you to change the user after it is configured. The username and password are configured in plaintext, which compromises data security.
  

* SCRAM-SHA-256

  Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) ensures security by authenticating the username and password. Kafka supports SCRAM-SHA-256, which can be used with Transport Layer Security (TLS). 

  SCRAM-SHA-256 allows you to change the user after it is configured, and the user data is stored in ZooKeeper. Before you start the broker, you must create a user for the communication between ZooKeeper and the broker. However, this authentication method requires that you configure the username and password in plaintext.
  

* SCRAM-SHA-512

  Kafka supports SCRAM-SHA-512, which can be used with TLS.
  




Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OMS console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management** .

   

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

   

4. In the **Add Data Source** dialog box, select **Kafka** for **Terminal Type** .

   

5. Specify the following parameters. 

   

   |     **Parameter**      |                                                                                            **Description**                                                                                            |
   |------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Data Source Identifier | The name of the data source.  The name must be 1 to 32 characters in length and can contain Chinese characters, digits, and case-sensitive English letters.                           |
   | Region                 | The region where the data source resides. Select a region from the drop-down list.  **Notice**  This parameter is displayed only when multiple regions are available. |
   | Kafka Endpoint         | The endpoint of the self-managed Kafka cluster, which is in the format of IP address:port number.                                                                                                     |
   | Enable SSL             | Specifies whether to enable SSL. To enable SSL, click **Upload File** , and upload an SSL certificate file with the file name extension `.jks`.                                                       |
   | Enable Authentication  | Specifies whether to enable authentication. Kafka allows you to configure data encryption and multiple identity authentication mechanisms to ensure data and service security.                        |
   | Authentication Method  | The authentication method that you use if authentication is enabled. OMS supports the following authentication methods: GSS-API, PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, and SCRAM-SHA-512.                             |
   | KDC Server Address     | The IP address or domain name of the server on which the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is deployed. This parameter is displayed only when you specify GSS-API as the authentication method.  |
   | User subject           | The username used to access the KDC server.  This parameter is displayed only when you specify GSS-API as the authentication method.                                                  |
   | SSL Certificate        | Click **Upload File** , and upload a key file with the file name extension `.keytab`.  This parameter is displayed only when you specify GSS-API as the authentication method.        |
   | Username               | The username used for data migration or synchronization.  If you select GSS-API as the authentication method, this parameter is not displayed.                                        |
   | Password               | The password used for data migration or synchronization.  If you select GSS-API as the authentication method, this parameter is not displayed.                                        |
   | Remarks                | Optional. Additional information about the data source.                                                                                                                                               |

   

6. Click **Test Connection** to test the network connection between OMS and the self-managed Kafka instance.

   

7. After the connection test succeeds, click **Add** .
