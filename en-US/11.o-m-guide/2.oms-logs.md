# OMS logs

The default directory for OMS logs is `/home/admin/logs/`. This topic describes the logs of different components of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS).

> **Note**
>
> To view OMS logs, you must log on to the server where OMS is deployed and then go to the container of OMS. Run the following command to go to the container where OMS is deployed:
>
> `docker exec -it <oms_container_name> bash`

## Logs of the console component

| Log type | Description |
---- | ----
| `common-default.log` | `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR` logs.  |
