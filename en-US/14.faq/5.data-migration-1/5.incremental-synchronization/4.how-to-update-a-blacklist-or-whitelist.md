## Working principles of whitelists and blacklists

Whitelists and blacklists provide differentiated configuration capabilities, such as database and table filtering, mapping, and extract, transform, and load (ETL). A blacklist or whitelist is in the following structure:

```json
[{
 "name": "db*",
 "map": "mdby",
 "func": "fn",
 "attr": {
  "ddl": "mmm",
  "hey": "hey"
 },
 "sub": [{
  "name": "mb*",
  "map": "tb2222",
  "func": "fn",
  "sub": [{
   "name": "c"
  }]
 }]
}, {
 "name": "db123",
 "map": "mdb5",
 "all": false,
 "attr": {
  "ddl": "zzz",
  "hey": "hey"
 },
 "sub": [{
  "name": "tb12345"
 }]
}]
```

A blacklist and a whitelist are two JSON arrays with the same semantics. Each element in an array is a JSON object, and each JSON object contains the following attributes:

| Property | Description |
|------|------------------------------|
| name | The name of the element at this level. The meaning varies the level. Generally, three levels are used: database, table, and column, with the database name at the uppermost level, the table name at the medium level, and the column names at the bottom level.  |
| map | The mapped-to name for this level. If this parameter is not specified, the value is the same as that of `name` of this level.  |
| all | Specifies whether all objects at the lower level are required. Default value: `true`. For the database level, the attribute specifies whether all tables in the database are required. For the table level, the attribute specifies whether all columns in the table are required.  |
| func | The matching rule of the name. func currently supports three modes. The exact mode is used by default, in which all characters must be the same. `fn` is the `fnmatch` mode of Linux. Objects starting with '.' cannot be matched. `reg` is the regular matching mode of Java. Objects are preferentially matched in exact mode, and then in fn and reg modes.  |
| attr | The attribute of this level, which is a JSON object. For example, the configurations for filtering the DML type are provided by using this attribute.  |
| sub | The object of the lower level, which is the same as the definition of this level. The meaning vary by level. The lower level of a database is tables, and the lower level of a table is columns.  |

> **Notice:**
>
> A match takes effect on the premise that it is in the whitelist but not in the blacklist.

## Modify a whitelist/blacklist

Take a JDBCWriter component as an example:

1. Stop the JDBCWriter component. For more information, see [Stop a JDBCWriter](../5.incremental-synchronization/3.start-and-stop-jdbcwriter.md).

2. Modify the corresponding fields based on the content to be modified. Examples:

   * Add a table: Add a JSON object under the sub attribute of the corresponding database, enter the corresponding name, map, and other attributes, and add the object to the sub array.

   * Delete a table: Find the table that you want to delete and delete it from the whitelist or add the configurations of the table to the blacklist.

3. Start the JDBCWriter.
