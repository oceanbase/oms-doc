# How do I upgrade Store?

This topic describes how to upgrade Store on a server.

## Upgrade Store

On the [RPM query page](http://rpm.corp.taobao.com/), query the version of the RPM package `oboms-xlog-store` required for the Store component. Download the package of the required version to the OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) server, and then run the `rpm -Uvh` command to install the package to upgrade the component. Procedure:

```shell
# Query the current version.
[root ~]# rpm -qa oboms-xlog-store
oboms-xlog-store-5.1.1-20220328193528.alios7.x86_64

# Upgrade the component after you obtain the RPM package of the new version.
[root ~]# rpm -Uvh oboms-xlog-store-5.1.2-20220518152726.alios7.x86_64.rpm
```

## Create a store based on the new version

Each `store\[XXXX\]` working directory is a sandbox environment. That is, the new version is valid only for a new store after the Store RPM package is installed. To create a store, perform the following operations:

1. Log on to the OMS console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **OPS & Monitoring** **>** **Component**. The **Store** tab automatically appears.

3. On the **Store** tab, click **Add** in the upper-right corner.

   * For single-region deployment, the region information is displayed on the right of **Store**.

   * For multi-region deployment, the **Region** column is displayed on the **Store** tab after you add a store.

4. In the **Add** dialog box, configure the parameters.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |-----------|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Subtopic | Yes | A cluster- or tenant-specific data source. Select a subtopic based on the specific task.  |
   | Node | No | The server on which the store is started. In standalone mode, only one server is deployed, and the store is created on that server by default. When no node is specified in high availability scenarios, the system automatically schedules the store to a server that has not experienced any performance bottleneck. <br>**Notice:**<br>If the component is upgraded on only some servers, select the corresponding node when you create the store.  |
   | Timestamp | Yes | The point in time from which the store is started.  Make sure that the database logs exist. Otherwise, the store may fail to start.  |

5. Click **Submit**.
